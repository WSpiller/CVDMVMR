"Zang, Ping; Zhou, Xiang","Causal Association Between Birth Weight and Adult Diseases: Evidence From a Mendelian Randomization Analysis","FRONTIERS IN GENETICS","Purpose: Birth weight has a profound long-term impact on individual's predisposition to various diseases at adulthood-a hypothesis commonly referred to as the fetal origins of adult diseases. However, it is not fully clear to what extent the fetal origins of adult diseases hypothesis holds and it is also not completely known what types of adult diseases are causally affected by birth weight. Materials and methods: Mendelian randomization using multiple genetic instruments associated with birth weight was performed to explore the causal relationship between birth weight and adult diseases. The causal relationship between birth weight and 21 adult diseases as well as 38 other complex traits was examined based on data collected from 37 large-scale genome-wide association studies with up to 340,000 individuals of European ancestry. Causal effects of birth weight were estimated using inverse-variance weighted methods. The identified causal relationships between birth weight and adult diseases were further validated through extensive sensitivity analyses, bias calculation, and simulations. Results: Among the 21 adult diseases, three were identified to be inversely causally affected by birth weight after the Bonferroni correction. The measurement unit of birth weight was defined as its standard deviation (i.e., 488 g), and one unit lower birth weight was causally related to an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and BMI-adjusted T2D, with the estimated odds ratios of 1.34[ 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.53], 1.30 (95% CI 1.13-1.51), 1.41 (95% CI 1.15-1.73), and 1.54 (95% CI 1.25-1.89), respectively. All these identified causal associations were robust across various sensitivity analyses that guard against various confounding due to pleiotropy or maternal effects as well as reverse causation. In addition, analysis on 38 additional complex traits did not identify candidate traits that may mediate the causal association between birth weight and CAD/MI/T2D. Conclusions: The results suggest that lower birth weight is causally associated with an increased risk of CAD, MI, and T2D in later life, supporting the fetal origins of adult diseases hypothesis.",2019,6

Long-term dyslipidaemia could contribute to the development of frailty in older individuals through its role in determining cardiovascular health and potentially other physiological pathways. Methods: We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using genetic variants to estimate the effects of long-term LDL-C modification on frailty in UK Biobank (n = 378,161). Frailty was derived from health questionnaire and interview responses at baseline when participants were aged 40 to 69 years, and calculated using an accumulation-of-deficits approach, i.e. the frailty index (FI). Several aggregated instrumental variables (IVs) using 50 and 274 genetic variants were constructed from independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to instrument circulating LDL-C concentrations. Specific sets of variants in or near genes that encode six lipid-lowering drug targets (HMGCR, PCSK9, NPC1L1, APOB, APOC3, and LDLR) were used to index effects of exposure to related drug classes on frailty. SNP-LDL-C effects were available from previously published studies. SNP-FI effects were obtained using adjusted linear regression models. Two-sample MR analyses were performed with the IVs as instruments using inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods. To address the stability of the findings, MR analyses were also performed using i) a modified FI excluding the cardiometabolic deficit items and ii) data from comparatively older individuals (aged = 60 years) only. Several sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Findings: On average 0.14% to 0.23% and 0.16% to 0.31% decrements in frailty were observed per standard deviation reduction in LDL-C exposure, instrumented by the general IVs consisting of 50 and 274 variants, respectively. Consistent, though less precise, associations were observed in the HMGCR-, APOC3-, NPC1L1-, and LDLR-specific IV analyses. In contrast, results for PCSK9 were in the same direction but more modest, and null for APOB. All sensitivity analyses produced similar findings. Interpretation: A genetically-predicted life-long lowering of LDL-C is associated with decreased frailty in midlife and older age, representing supportive evidence for LDL-C's role in multiple health- and age-related pathways. The use of lipid-lowering therapeutics with varying mechanisms of action may differ by the extent to which they provide overall health benefits. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2019,6

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, is positively associated with cardiac events, and may be relevant to cancer. We used Mendelian Randomization to obtain unconfounded estimates of the association of IDO1 with ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke and their risk factors, all-cancer, cancer of the prostate, lung and bronchus, and breast. We obtained genetic instruments independently and strongly (p-value < 5 x 10(-)(8)) predicting plasma IDO1 from a proteome genome-wide association study (GWAS), and applied them to consortia GWAS of the outcomes, including the UK Biobank SOFT CAD GWAS (cases < = 76 014, non-cases < = 264 785) for IHD. Estimates were obtained using inverse variance weighting; with MR-Egger, weighted median and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses. IDO1 was inversely associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.96 per standard deviation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.00, p-value = 0.04), diabetes (OR 0.91,95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) and prostate cancer (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99) with a directionally consistent estimate for stroke (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.02) but not with blood pressure, or the other cancers considered. IDO1 might be a potential therapeutic target for IHD, diabetes and prostate cancer.",2019,6

Cardiovascular diseases represent a major health issue in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but the exact nature of cardiometabolic (CM) abnormalities involved and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Psychiatric medications are known risk factors, but it is unclear whether there is a connection between the disorders (SCZ/BD) themselves and CM abnormalities. Methods. Using polygenic risk scores and linkage disequilibrium score regression, we investigated the shared genetic bases of SCZ and BD with 28 CM traits. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate causal relationships between the two groups of disorders. The analysis was based on large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. We also identified the potential shared genetic variants and inferred the pathways involved. Results. We found tentative polygenic associations of SCZ with glucose metabolism abnormalities, adverse adipokine profiles, increased waist-to-hip ratio and visceral adiposity (false discovery rate or FDR<0.05). However, there was an inverse association with body mass index. For BD, we observed several polygenic associations with favorable CM profiles at FDR<0.05. MR analysis showed that SCZ may be causally linked to raised triglyceride and that lower fasting glucose may be linked to BD. We also identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and pathways shared between SCZ/BD with CM traits, some of which are related to inflammation or the immune system. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that SCZ patients may be genetically predisposed to several CM abnormalities independent of medication side effects. On the other hand, CM abnormalities in BD may be more likely to be secondary. However, the findings require further validation.",2019,6

Specific therapies to lower Lp(a) are on the horizon, but the required reduction of Lp(a) to translate into clinically relevant lowering of CHD outcomes is a matter of debate. OBJECTIVE To estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size that may be associated with a reduction of CHD outcomes compared with the effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Genetic epidemiologic study using a mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size for a clinically meaningful effect on outcomes. We used the effect estimates for Lp(a) from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis on Lp(a) published in 2017 of 5 different primarily population-based studies of European ancestry. All Lp(a) measurements were performed in 1 laboratory. Genetic estimates for 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on Lp(a) concentrations were used. Odds ratios for these 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CHD risk were retrieved from a subsample of the CHD Exome+ consortium. EXPOSURES Genetic LPA score, plasma Lp(a) concentrations, and observations of statin therapies on CHD outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary heart disease. RESULTS The study included 13 781 individuals from the Lp(a)-GWAS-Consortium from 5 primarily population-based studies and 20 793 CHD cases and 27 540 controls from a subsample of the CHD Exome+ consortium. Four of the studies were similar in age distribution (means between 51 and 59 years), and 1 cohort was younger; mean age, 32 years. The frequency of women was similar between 51% and 55%. We estimated that the required reduction in Lp(a) effect size would be 65.7mg/dL (95% CI, 46.3-88.3) to reach the same potential effect on clinical outcomes that can be reached by lowering LDL-C by 38.67mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This mendelian randomization analysis estimated a required Lp(a)-lowering effect size of 65.7mg/dL to reach the same effect as a 38.67-mg/dL lowering of LDL-C. However, this estimate is determined by the observed effect estimates of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on Lp(a) concentrations and is therefore influenced by the standardization of the Lp(a) assay used. As a consequence, calculations of the required Lp(a)-lowering potential of a drug to be clinically effective might have been overestimated in the past.",2019,6

DESIGN Mendelian randomisation study. SETTING UK Biobank and international genome-wide association study data. PARTICIPANTS Predominantly participants of European ancestry. EXPOSURE Educational attainment, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour in observational analysis, and randomly allocated genetic variants to instrument these traits in mendelian randomisation. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE The risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease (all subtypes; all measured in odds ratio), and the degree to which this is mediated through BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour respectively. RESULTS Each additional standard deviation of education (3.6 years) was associated with a 13% lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89) in observational analysis and a 37% lower risk (0.63, 0.60 to 0.67) in mendelian randomisation analysis. As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15% (95% confidence interval 13% to 17%) and 18% (14% to 23%) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11% (9% to 13%) and 21% (15% to 27%) for systolic blood pressure and 19% (15% to 22%) and 34% (17% to 50%) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42% (36% to 48%) and 36% (5% to 68%) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.",2019,6

Early attempts at evaluating the causal effect of fibrinogen on coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infraction (MI) using Mendelian randomization (MR) used single variant approaches, and did not take advantage of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or multi-variant, pleiotropy robust MR methodologies. Methods and findings We evaluated evidence for a causal effect of fibrinogen on both CHD and MI using MR. We used both an allele score approach and pleiotropy robust MR models. The allele score was composed of 38 fibrinogen-associated variants from recent GWAS. Initial analyses using the allele score used a meta-analysis of 11 European-ancestry prospective cohorts, free of CHD and MI at baseline, to examine incidence CHD and MI. We also applied 2 sample MR methods with data from a prevalent CHD and MI GWAS. Results are given in terms of the hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), depending on the study design, and associated 95% confidence interval (CI). In single variant analyses no causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD or MI was observed. In multi-variant analyses using incidence CHD cases and the allele score approach, the estimated causal effect (HR) of a 1 g/L higher fibrinogen concentration was 1.62 (CI = 1.12, 2.36) when using incident cases and the allele score approach. In 2 sample MR analyses that accounted for pleiotropy, the causal estimate (OR) was reduced to 1.18 (CI = 0.98, 1.42) and 1.09 (CI = 0.89, 1.33) in the 2 most precise (smallest CI) models, out of 4 models evaluated. In the 2 sample MR analyses for MI, there was only very weak evidence of a causal effect in only 1 out of 4 models. Conclusions A small causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD is observed using multi-variant MR approaches which account for pleiotropy, but not single variant MR approaches. Taken together, results indicate that even with large sample sizes and multi-variant approaches MR analyses still cannot exclude the null when estimating the causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD, but that any potential causal effect is likely to be much smaller than observed in epidemiological studies.",2019,6

Studies in east Asia can help determine whether these associations are causal, since two common genetic variants greatly affect alcohol drinking patterns. We used these two variants to assess the relationships between cardiovascular risk and genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake in men, contrasting the findings in men with those in women (few of whom drink). Methods The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank enrolled 512 715 adults between June 25, 2004, and July 15, 2008, from ten areas of China, recording alcohol use and other characteristics. It followed them for about 10 years (until Jan 1, 2017), monitoring cardiovascular disease (including ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction) by linkage with morbidity and mortality registries and electronic hospital records. 161 498 participants were genotyped for two variants that alter alcohol metabolism, ALDH2-rs671 and ADH1B-rs1229984. Adjusted Cox regression was used to obtain the relative risks associating disease incidence with self-reported drinking patterns (conventional epidemiology) or with genotype-predicted mean male alcohol intake (genetic epidemiology-ie, Mendelian randomisation), with stratification by study area to control for variation between areas in disease rates and in genotype-predicted intake. Findings 33% (69 897/210 205) of men reported drinking alcohol in most weeks, mainly as spirits, compared with only 2% (6245/302 510) of women. Among men, conventional epidemiology showed that self-reported alcohol intake had U-shaped associations with the incidence of ischaemic stroke (n=14930), intracerebral haemorrhage (n=3496), and acute myocardial infarction (n=2958); men who reported drinking about 100 g of alcohol per week (one to two drinks per day) had lower risks of all three diseases than non-drinkers or heavier drinkers. In contrast, although genotype-predicted mean male alcohol intake varied widely (from 4 to 256 g per week-ie, near zero to about four drinks per day), it did not have any U-shaped associations with risk. For stroke, genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake had a continuously positive log-linear association with risk, which was stronger for intracerebral haemorrhage (relative risk [RR] per 280 g per week 1.58, 95% CI 1.36-1.84, p<0.0001) than for ischaemic stroke (1.27, 1.13-1.43, p=0.0001). For myocardial infarction, however, genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake was not significantly associated with risk (RR per 280 g per week 0.96, 95% CI 0.78-1.18, p=0.69). Usual alcohol intake in current drinkers and genotype-predicted alcohol intake in all men had similarly strong positive associations with systolic blood pressure (each p<0.0001). Among women, few drank and the studied genotypes did not predict high mean alcohol intake and were not positively associated with blood pressure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Interpretation Genetic epidemiology shows that the apparently protective effects of moderate alcohol intake against stroke are largely non-causal. Alcohol consumption uniformly increases blood pressure and stroke risk, and appears in this one study to have little net effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

A.; Koek, Ger H.; Schaper, Nicolaas C.; Isaacs, Aaron","Relationship Between Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Susceptibility Genes and Coronary Artery Disease","HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether NAFLD is causally involved in the pathogenesis of CAD. For this, previously reported NAFLD susceptibility genes were clustered and tested for an association with CAD in the Coronary Artery Disease Genomc-Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) Consortium data set. The role of plasma lipids as a potential mediator was explored by using data from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. Statistical analyses revealed that the combination of 12 NAFLD genes was not associated with CAD in 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls (odds ratio [OR] per NAFLD risk allele, 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.00). In a subsequent sensitivity analysis, a positive relationship was observed after exclusion of gene variants that are implicated in NAFLD through impaired very low-density lipoprotein secretion (i.e., microsomal triglyceride transfer protein [MTTP], patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 [PNPLA3], phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase [PEMT], and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 [TM6SF2]) (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02). Clustering of the excluded genes showed a significant negative relationship with CAD (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99). A substantial proportion of the observed heterogeneity between the individual NAFLD genes in relation to CAD could be explained by plasma lipids, as reflected by a strong relationship between plasma lipids and CAD risk conferred by the NAFLD susceptibility genes (r = 0.76; P = 0.004 for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Conclusion: NAFLD susceptibility genes do not cause CAD per se. The relationship between these genes and CAD appears to depend to a large extent on plasma lipids. These observations strongly suggest taking plasma lipids into account when designing a new drug to target NAFLD.",2019,6

Ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) account for an equal number of deaths in China, despite a fourfold greater incidence of IS1,2. Stroke incidence and ICH proportion are higher in China than in Western populations(3-5), despite having a lower mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. Observational studies reported weaker positive associations of LDL-C with IS than with coronary heart disease (CHD)(6,7), but LDL-C-lowering trials demonstrated similar risk reductions for IS and CHD8-10. Mendelian randomization studies of LDL-C and IS have reported conflicting results(11-13), and concerns about the excess risks of ICH associated with lowering LDL-C-14,C-15 may have prevented the more widespread use of statins in China. We examined the associations of biochemically measured lipids with stroke in a nested case-control study in the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and compared the risks for both stroke types associated with equivalent differences in LDL-C in Mendelian randomization analyses. The results demonstrated positive associations of LDL-C with IS and equally strong inverse associations with ICH, which were confirmed by genetic analyses and LDL-C-lowering trials.

Objectives: This population-based prospective cohort study sought to investigate the bidirectional causal relations of T2D with hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Methods and Results: After exclusion of participants free of a history of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, cardiac procedures, and non-T2D diabetes mellitus, a total of 318 664 unrelated individuals with qualified genotyping data of European descent aged 37 to 73 from UK Biobank were included. The genetically instrumented T2D and hypertension were constructed using 134 and 233 single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. Seven complementary MR methods were applied, including inverse-variance weighted method, 2 median-based methods (simple and weighted), MR-Egger, MR-robust adjusted profile scores, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier, and multivariate MR. The genetically instrumented T2D was associated with risk of hypertension (odds ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.10], P=3.4x10(-7)), whereas the genetically determined hypertension showed no relationship with T2D (odds ratio, 0.96 [0.88-1.04], P=0.34). Our MR estimates from T2D to BP showed that the genetically instrumented T2D was associated with a 0.67 mm Hg higher systolic BP (95% CI, 0.41-0.93, P=5.75x10-7) but not with a higher diastolic BP. There was no clear evidence showing a causal effect of elevated systolic BP or diastolic BP on T2D risk. Positive pleiotropic bias was indicated in the hypertension. T2D relation (odds ratio, of MREgger intercept 1.010 [1.004-1.016], P=0.001) but not from T2D to hypertension (1.001 [0.998-1.004], P=0.556). Conclusions: T2D may causally affect hypertension, whereas the relationship from hypertension to T2D is unlikely to be causal. These findings suggest the importance of keeping an optimal glycemic profile in general populations, and BP screening and monitoring, especially systolic BP, in patients with T2D.",2019,6

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes associated with SUA, mainly in European populations. However, to date there arc few GWAS in Latino populations, and the role of SUA-associatal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cardiovascular disease has not been studied in the Mexican population. Methods: We performed genome-wide SUA association study in 2153 Mexican children and adults, evaluated whether genetic effects were modified by sex and obesity, and used a Mendelian randomization approach in an independent cohort to study the role of SUA modifying genetic variants in premature CAD. Results: Only two loci were associated with SUA levels: SLC2A9( beta = -0.47 mg/dl, P = 1.57 x 10(-42) for lead SNP rs7678287) and ABCG2 023 mg /dl, P 2.42 x 10-1 for lead SNP rs2231142). No significant interaction between SLC2A9 rs7678287 and ABCG2 rs2231142 genotypes and obesity was observed. However, a significant ABCG2 rs2231142 genotype*sex interaction (P 0.001) was observed in adults but not in children. Although SUA levels were associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and decreased glomerular filtration rate (eGER), only ABCG2 rs2231142 was associated with decreased eGFR in the premature CAD group. Conclusions: SUA elevation was independently associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and decreased eGFR in the Mexican population. However, a Mendelian randomization approach using the lead SUA-associated SNPs (SLC2A9 and ABC'62) did not support a causal role of elevated SUA levels for premature CAD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Zhao, Jie V.; Schooling, C. Mary","Effect of linoleic acid on ischemic heart disease and its risk factors: a Mendelian randomization study","BMC MEDICINE","BackgroundThe role of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in ischemic heart disease (IHD) is controversial, and dietary guidelines vary. Observationally, lower saturated fat intake and higher intake of vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid (LA), the main n-6 PUFA, is associated with lower IHD and diabetes; however, randomized controlled trials have not fully corroborated these benefits. We assessed how genetically predicted LA affected IHD and its risk factors, including diabetes, lipids, and blood pressure. We also assessed the role of LA in reticulocyte count, the red blood cell precursor, which has recently been identified as a possible causal factor in IHD.MethodsTwo-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments, i.e., Mendelian randomization, was used to obtain unconfounded estimates using genetic variants strongly (p value <5x10(-8)) and solely associated with LA, applied to an IHD case (n76,014)-control (n264,785) study (mainly based on the meta-analysis of CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes and UK Biobank CAD SOFT GWAS), the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis diabetes case (n=26,676)-control (n=132,532) study, lipids from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n=196,475), and reticulocyte count and blood pressure from the UK Biobank (n361,194). A weighted median and Mendelian randomization Egger were used for sensitivity analysis.ResultsGenetically predicted LA was not associated with IHD or systolic blood pressure. Genetically predicted higher serum LA was associated with lower diabetes (odds ratio (OR) 0.97 per percentage in total fatty acid increase in LA, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 0.99) and lower lipids (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol), but may be associated with higher diastolic blood pressure. The findings were robust to different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selections, analytic methods, and correction for multiple testing.ConclusionsOur novel study suggests a benefit of LA for diabetes and lipids but no benefit for IHD, blood pressure, or reticulocyte count. Explicating these paradoxical findings would facilitate identification of effective new interventions for diabetes and IHD.",2019,6

DESIGN Two sample mendelian randomisation study using genetic variants as instrumental variables, randomly allocated at conception, to infer causality as additional randomised evidence. SETTING Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) randomised controlled trial, UK Biobank, and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes based genome wide association study. PARTICIPANTS 3225 men of European ancestry aged 50-75 in REDUCE; 392 038 white British men and women aged 40-69 from the UK Biobank; and 171 875 participants of about 77% European descent, from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes based study for validation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Thromboembolism, heart failure, and myocardial infarction based on self reports, hospital episodes, and death. RESULTS Of the UK Biobank participants, 13 691 had thromboembolism (6208 men, 7483 women), 1688 had heart failure (1186, 502), and 12 882 had myocardial infarction (10 136, 2746). In men, endogenous testosterone genetically predicted by variants in the JMJD1C gene region was positively associated with thromboembolism (odds ratio per unit increase in log transformed testosterone (nmol/L) 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 3.46) and heart failure (7.81, 2.56 to 23.8), but not myocardial infarction (1.17, 0.78 to 1.75). Associations were less obvious in women. In the validation study, genetically predicted testosterone (based on JMJD1C gene region variants) was positively associated with myocardial infarction (1.37, 1.03 to 1.82). No excess heterogeneity was observed among genetic variants in their associations with the outcomes. However, testosterone genetically predicted by potentially pleiotropic variants in the SHBG gene region had no association with the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Endogenous testosterone was positively associated with thromboembolism, heart failure, and myocardial infarction in men. Rates of these conditions are higher in men than women. Endogenous testosterone can be controlled with existing treatments and could be a modifiable risk factor for thromboembolism and heart failure.",2019,6

We used Mendelian randomization to assess the role of thyroid dysfunction for cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with thyroid function were identified from a genome-wide association meta-analysis in up to 72 167 individuals. Data for genetic associations with CVD were obtained from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of atrial fibrillation (n= 537 409 individuals), coronary artery disease (n= 184 305 individuals), and ischemic stroke (n= 438 847) as well as from the UK Biobank (n= 367 703 individuals). RESULTS: Genetically predicted thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and hyperthyroidism were statistically significantly associated with atrial fibrillation but no other CVDs at the Bonferroni-corrected level of significance (P< 7.8x10-4). The odds ratios of atrial fibrillation were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.19; P= 2.4x10-14) per genetically predicted 1 SD decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08; P= 5.4x10-5) for genetic predisposition to hyperthyroidism. Genetically predicted free thyroxin levels were not statistically significantly associated with any CVD. CONCLUSIONS: This Mendelian randomization study supports evidence for a causal association of decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in the direction of a mild form of hyperthyroidism with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation but no other CVDs.",2019,6

The present analysis was designed to investigate the association of LDL triglycerides with cardiovascular mortality and to explore possible mechanisms that may link LDL triglycerides to cardiovascular risk. Methods: LDL triglycerides were measured in 3140 participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study. They were prospectively followed for cardiovascular mortality (median duration 9.9 years). Genome wide association data for LDL triglycerides were available for 2900 LURIC participants. Genetic data and measurements of hepatic lipase activity were available for 478 participants of the HERITAGE Family study. Genome wide association data for cardiovascular disease were available for 184,305 participants of the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium. Results: There was a continuous positive association between LDL triglycerides and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio for 5th vs. 1st quintile = 2.53, p < 0.001) and this association was similar in males and females. Genome wide association analysis in LURIC revealed that LDL triglycerides were strongly associated with variation in the hepatic lipase region (p < 10(-15) for rs1800588 and rs10468017). The LDL triglyceride raising alleles in rs1800588 and rs10468017 were associated with low hepatic lipase activity in HERITAGE and increased cardiovascular risk in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (HERITAGE and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) using rs1800588 and rs10468017 as instrumental variable suggested that low hepatic lipase activity may cause increased cardiovascular risk (p = 0.013).

Few genetic loci regulating FVII activity and/or levels have been discovered to date. We conducted a meta-analysis of 9 genome-wide association studies of plasma FVII levels (7 FVII activity and 2 FVII antigen) among 27 495 participants of European and African ancestry. Each study performed ancestry-specific association analyses. Inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was performed within each ancestry group and then combined for a trans-ancestry meta-analysis. Our primary analysis included the 7 studies that measured FVII activity, and a secondary analysis included all 9 studies. We provided functional genomic validation for newly identified significant loci by silencing candidate genes in a human liver cell line (HuH7) using small-interfering RNA and then measuring F7 messenger RNA and FVII protein expression. Lastly, we used meta-analysis results to perform Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of FVII activity on coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke (IS), and venous thromboembolism. We identified 2 novel (REEP3 and JAZF1-AS1) and 6 known loci associated with FVII activity, explaining 19.0% of the phenotypic variance. Adding FVII antigen data to the meta-analysis did not result in the discovery of further loci. Silencing REEP3 in HuH7 cells upregulated FVII, whereas silencing JAZF1 downregulated FVII. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that FVII activity has a positive causal effect on the risk of IS. Variants at REEP3 and JAZF1 contribute to FVII activity by regulating F7 expression levels. FVII activity appears to contribute to the etiology of IS in the general population.",2019,6

The corresponding data for ischemic stroke were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium (34,217 cases and 404,630 noncases). Results In standard mendelian randomization analysis, the odds ratios for each 0.1 mmol/L (about 1 SD) increase in genetically predicted serum magnesium concentrations were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI-] 0.69-0.89; p = 1.3 x 10(-4)) for all ischemic stroke, 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.80; p = 1.6 x 10(-4)) for cardioembolic stroke, and 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.82; p = 0.001) for large artery stroke; there was no association with small vessel stroke (odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.67-1.20; p = 0.46). Only the association with cardioembolic stroke was robust in sensitivity analyses. There was no association of genetically predicted serum calcium concentrations with all ischemic stroke (per 0.5 mg/dL [about 1 SD] increase in serum calcium: odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.21) or with any subtype.

Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) is an approach that enables the collection of precise phenotypic measures in smaller studies, while maintaining statistical power and ability for causal inference. METHODS: In this study, we used a combination of conventional multivariable regression analysis, Mendelian randomization (MR), and subsample RbG methodologies to estimate the causal effect of BMI on gross-level and detailed cardiovascular health in healthy participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17 years (N=1420-3108 for different outcomes) and an independent sample from the same cohort (for RbG) study at age 21 years (N=386-418). RESULTS: In both MR and RbG analyses, results suggested that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure and left ventricular mass index in young adults (eg, difference in left ventricular mass index per 1 kg/m(2) using MR: 1.07 g/m(2.7); 95% CI, 0.62-1.52; P=3.87x10(-06) and per 3.58 kg/m(2) using RbG: 1.65 g/m(2.7); 95% CI, 0.83-2.47; P=0.0001). Additionally, RbG results suggested a causal role of higher BMI on higher stroke volume (difference per 3.58 kg/m(2): 1.49 mL/m(2.04); 95% CI, 0.62-2.35; P=0.001) and cardiac output (difference per 3.58 kg/m(2): 0.11 L.min(-1).m(-1.83); 95% CI, 0.03-0.19; P=0.01) but no strong evidence for a causal role on systemic vascular resistance or total arterial compliance. Neither analysis supported a causal role of higher BMI on heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of sensitivity analyses, suggest that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, even in youth. Higher BMI also resulted in increased cardiac output in the RbG study, which appeared to be solely driven by stroke volume, as neither MR nor RbG analyses suggested a causal effect of BMI on heart rate. These consistent results support efforts to reduce BMI from a young age to prevent later adverse cardiovascular health and illustrate the potential for phenotypic resolution with maintained analytic power using RbG.",2018,6

Despite great progress in the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease, it remains the leading cause of global mortality and morbidity, with new unexpected risk factors emerging and few effective new pharmaceutical treatments. ADAMTS-13 is involved in a clotting disorder, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, for which new treatments are being developed. Observationally, ADAMTS-13 activity is inversely associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) but positively associated with diabetes. Objectives: To obtain unconfounded estimates of the effect of ADAMTS-13 on IHD, diabetes and lipids. Methods: We applied genetic variants strongly, (P < 5 x 10(-8)), solely and independently associated with ADAMTS-13 to the largest available extensively geno-typed case-control studies of IHD and diabetes and to a large study of lipids to obtain Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimates. Sensitivity was evaluated through weighted median and MR-Egger estimates. Results: Genetically predicted ADAMTS-13 activity, based on three genetic variants, was consistently inversely associated with IHD (IVW odds ratio [OR] 0.91 per effect size; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.97) but not with diabetes (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-1.01) or high or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04; -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02, respectively). ADAMTS-13 antigen, based on four genetic variants, was not associated with any outcome. Conclusions: This genetic validation of ADAMTS-13 activity as a target of intervention in IHD raises the possibility of new ways of prevention and treatment being developed by repurposing therapeutics that raise ADAMTS-13 activity, or by other environmental or dietary interventions that raise ADAMTS-13 activity.",2018,6

It is unknown whether lower FXI levels have a protective effect on risk of ischemic stroke (IS) or myocardial infarction. This study investigated the effect of genetically determined FXI levels on risk of IS, myocardial infarction, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed. Instruments and genetic association estimates for FXI levels were obtained from a genome-wide association study of 16 169 individuals. Genetic association estimates for IS and its etiological subtypes were obtained from a study of 16 851 cases and 32 473 controls. For myocardial infarction, estimates were obtained from a study of 43 676 cases and 123 504 controls and for intracerebral hemorrhage from a study of 1545 cases and 1481 controls. Results After applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the Mendelian randomization analysis supported a causal effect of higher, genetically determined FXI levels on risk of any IS (odds ratio [OR] per 1-unit increase in natural logarithm-transformed FXI levels, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.68-3.84; P=1x10(-5)) but not myocardial infarction (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.34; P=0.94) or intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.44-7.38; P=0.41). Examining IS subtypes, the main results supported an effect of higher, genetically determined FXI levels on risk of cardioembolism (OR, 4.23; 95% CI, 1.94-9.19; P=3x10(-4)) and IS of undetermined cause (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.79-6.60; P=2x10(-4)) but not large artery atherosclerosis (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.15-6.45; P=0.02) or small artery occlusion (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.50-2.82; P=0.69).

To clarify, we examined the role of genetically predicted adiponectin in CAD in a larger study and additionally examined the role of genetically predicted CAD in adiponectin using a bi-directional Mendelian randomization study. Methods: We obtained estimates using inverse variance weighting (IVW) with multiplicative random effects, based on 21 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) to predict adiponectin and 28 SNPs for CAD, using two large genome wide association studies of adiponectin (ADIPOGen Consortium (n=39,883)) and CAD CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes based GWAS (n=60,801 CAD cases; n=123,504 controls). Sensitivity analyses included using MR-Egger, weighted median method, and exclusion of potentially invalid (pleiotropic) SNPs. Results: Adiponectin was inversely associated with CAD (odds ratio 0.82 per unit increase log transformed adiponectin, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.94) using IVW. However, the association was null using a weighted median method or MR-Egger, or after exclusion of pleiotropic SNPs acting on obesity related traits. CAD was not associated with adiponectin (-0.011 log transformed adiponectin unit per log odds CAD, 95% CI -0.039 to 0.017), with similar findings from MR-Egger, weighted median method or exclusion of pleiotropic SNPs. Conclusion: Adiponectin is unlikely a cause of CAD although we cannot completely rule out the possibility. Previous observational studies are likely driven by factors driving both adiponectin and CAD, whose elucidation might provide new insights concerning interventions for CAD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DESIGN Two sample, bidirectional mendelian randomisation study. SETTING Genetic data taken from various cohorts comprised of the general population (mostly individuals of European ancestry, plus a small proportion of other ancestries); follow-up analysis included individuals from the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS Summary data were used from previous genome wide association studies (number of participants ranging from 83 198 to 339 224), which investigated traits related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, had the largest sample sizes, and consisted of the most similar populations while minimising sample overlap. A follow-up analysis included 337112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54% female (n=181363), mean age 56.87 years (standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Subjective wellbeing and 11 measures of cardiometabolic health (coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; total, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; diastolic and systolic blood pressure; body fat; waist to hip ratio; waist circumference; and body mass index). RESULTS Evidence of a causal effect of body mass index on subjective wellbeing was seen; each 1 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index caused a -0.045 (95% confidence interval -0.084 to -0.006, P=0.02) standard deviation reduction in subjective wellbeing. Follow-up analysis of this association in an independent sample from the UK Biobank provided strong evidence of an effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health (beta=-0.035 unit decrease in health satisfaction (95% confidence interval -0.043 to -0.027) per standard deviation increase in body mass index, P<0.001). No clear evidence of a causal effect was seen between subjective wellbeing and the other cardiometabolic health measures, in either direction. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that a higher body mass index is associated with a lower subjective wellbeing. A follow-up analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting that the effect in middle aged people could be driven by satisfaction with health. Body mass index is a modifiable determinant, and therefore, this study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher body mass index on subjective wellbeing.",2018,6

However, associations with some control outcomes were in the opposite direction to that expected. Conclusions: Sex hormone-related mechanisms appear to be relevant to cardiovascular risk factors and for stroke (particularly for men). However, the extent that these findings are specifically informative about endogenous testosterone or testosterone supplementation is unclear. These findings underline a fundamental limitation for the use of Mendelian randomization where biological knowledge about the function of genetic variants is uncertain. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Mary","The Impact of Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) on Cardiovascular Disease Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Study Using UK Biobank","DIABETES CARE","OBJECTIVEGlycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) is positively associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), although evidence is primarily observational. Mendelian randomization studies have only examined its relation with subtypes of CVD. We examined the relation of HbA(1c) with CVD and its subtypes in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe used 38 genetic variants strongly and independently related to HbA(1c) (n = 123,665) applied to the UK Biobank (n = 392,038). We used inverse variance weighting (IVW) to obtain the associations of HbA(1c) with CVD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke (overall and stroke subtypes). Sensitivity analyses included Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger, a weighted median, and exclusion of potentially invalid single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also applied the same genetic instruments to CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) 1000 Genomes-based genome-wide association study (n = 184,305) as a validation for CAD.RESULTSIn the UK Biobank, HbA(1c) was not associated with CVD using IVW (odds ratio [OR] 1.11 per %, 95% CI 0.83-1.48). However, HbA(1c) was associated with increased CAD risk (OR 1.50 per %, 95% CI 1.08-2.11) with directionally consistent results from MR-Egger and weighted median. The positive association with CAD was more pronounced when we excluded potentially invalid SNPs (OR 2.24 per %, 95% CI 1.55-3.25). The positive association was replicated in CARDIoGRAM (OR 1.52 per %, 95% CI 1.03-2.26). The association of HbA(1c) with stroke and its subtypes was less clear given the low number of cases.CONCLUSIONSHbA(1c) likely causes CAD. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.",2018,6

Mary","Effects of copper and zinc on ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction: a Mendelian randomization study","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION","Background: Despite great progress in prevention and control, ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Diet plays a key role in IHD, but a comprehensive delineation of the role of dietary factors in IHD is not yet quite complete. Objective: The aim of this study was to test the long-standing hypothesis that copper is protective and zinc harmful in IHD. Design: We used separate-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments (Mendelian randomization). We obtained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a genome wide association study, strongly (P value < 5 x 10(-8)) and independently associated with erythrocyte copper and zinc. We applied these genetic predictors of copper and zinc to the largest, most extensively genotyped IHD case (n <= 76014)-control (n <= 264785) study, based largely on CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes and the UK Biobank SOFT CAD, to obtain SNP-specific Wald estimates for the effects of copper and zinc on IHD, which were combined through the use of inverse variance weighting. Sensitivity analysis included use of the MR-Egger method, and reanalysis including SNPs independently associated with erythrocyte copper and zinc at P value < 5 x 10(-6). Results: Genetically instrumented copper was negatively associated with IHD (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98). Genetically instrumented zinc was positively associated with IHD (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.11). Sensitivity analysis via MR-Egger gave no indication of unknown pleiotropy; less strongly associated SNPs gave similar results for copper. Conclusion: Genetic validation of a long-standing hypothesis suggests that further investigation of the effects, particularly of copper, on IHD may provide a practical means of reducing the leading cause of mortality and morbidity.",2018,6

Methods We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify disease outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci. We then implemented conventional Mendelianrandomisation (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relevance between SUA level and disease outcomes identified from PheWAS. We next applied MR Egger analysis to detect and account for potential pleiotropy, which conventional MR analysis might mistake for causality, and used the HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test to remove cross-phenotype associations that were likely due to genetic linkage. Results Our PheWAS identified 25 disease groups/outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci after multiple testing correction (P<8.57e-05). Our conventional MR analysis implicated a causal role of SUA level in three disease groups: inflammatory polyarthropathies (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.34), hypertensive disease (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14) and disorders of metabolism (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14); and four disease outcomes: gout (OR=4.88, 95% CI 3.91 to 6.09), essential hypertension (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14), myocardial infarction (OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30) and coeliac disease (OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89). After balancing pleiotropic effects in MR Egger analysis, only gout and its encompassing disease group of inflammatory polyarthropathies were considered to be causally associated with SUA level. Our analysis highlighted a locus (ATXN2/S2HB3) that may influence SUA level and multiple cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases via pleiotropy. Conclusions Elevated SUA level is convincing to cause gout and inflammatory polyarthropathies, and might act as a marker for the wider range of diseases with which it associates. Our findings support further investigation on the clinical relevance of SUA level with cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and respiratory diseases.",2018,6

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal effect of obesity on hypertension.The MR analysis was performed in a well-defined community cohort study of 8832 middle-aged (40-69 years) adults in Korea enrolled from 2001 to 2013. We used baseline hypertension and newly diagnosed hypertension during the 10-year follow-up period as the outcome variable. Genetic risk score associated with body mass index (BMI GRS) was used as the instrumental variable (IV) to measure the causal relationship between obesity and hypertension. The IV estimate of causal odds ratio (OR) was derived using the Wald ratio estimator and then exponentiation to express the result as an OR.In the multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, study area, education, smoking, and current alcohol consumption, each 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with a 19% (OR: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.21) increase in hypertension risk. We selected 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (P<1.0x10(-5)) associated with BMI by genome-wide screening using linear regression and created 6 types of GRS. We demonstrated that each standard-deviation increase in BMI GRS was associated with a 5% to 6% (OR: 1.05-1.06) increased risk of hypertension (all P<.05). Using BMI GRS as the IV, we found a causal relationship between BMI and hypertension (OR: 1.13-1.26, all P<.05 except weighted GRS [n=6]).Using Mendelian randomization, we found that obesity is causally associated with hypertension. This information will have important public health implications, supporting evidence that obesity-reduction programs will reduce the incidence of hypertension.",2018,6

OBJECTIVE To estimate the magnitude of the change in plasma Lp(a) levels needed to have the same evidence of an association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/dL (ie, 1-mmol/L) change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, a change that has been shown to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of CHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using individual participant data from 5 studies and with external validation using summarized data from 48 studies. Population-based prospective cohort and case-control studies featured 20 793 individuals with CHD and 27 540 controls with individual participant data, whereas summarized data included 62 240 patients with CHD and 127 299 controls. Data were analyzed from November 2016 to March 2018. EXPOSURES Genetic LPA score and plasma Lp(a) mass concentration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary heart disease. RESULTS Of the included study participants. 53% were men, all were of white European ancestry, and the mean age was 57.5 years. The association of genetically predicted Lp(a) with CHD risk was linearly proportional to the absolute change in Lp(a) concentration. A 10-mg/dL lower genetically predicted Lp(a) concentration was associated with a 5.8% lower CHD risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.942; 95% CI, 0.933-0.951; P = 3 x 10(-37)), whereas a 10-mg/dL lower genetically predicted LDL-C level estimated using an LDL-C genetic score was associated with a 14.5% lower CHD risk (OR, 0.855; 95% CI, 0.818-0.893; P = 2 x 10(-17)). Thus, a 101.5-mg/dL change (95% CI, 71.0-137.0) in Lp(a) concentration had the same association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/dL change in LDL-C level. The association of genetically predicted Lp(a) concentration with CHD risk appeared to be independent of changes in LDL-C level owing to genetic variants that mimic the relationship of statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe with CHD risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The clinical benefit of lowering Lp(a) is likely to be proportional to the absolute reduction in Lp(a) concentration. Large absolute reductions in Lp(a) of approximately 100 mg/dL may be required to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of CHD similar in magnitude to what can be achieved by lowering LDL-C level by 38.67 mg/dL (ie, 1 mmol/L).",2018,6

The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower birthweight is causal for these diseases, but causality is difficult to infer from observational studies. METHODS: We performed regression analyses to assess associations of birthweight with cardiovascular disease and T2D in 237 631 individuals from the UK Biobank. Further, we assessed the causal relationship of such associations using Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: In the observational analyses, birthweight showed inverse associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (beta, -0.83 and -0.26; per raw unit in outcomes and SD change in birthweight; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.90 to -0.75 and -0.31 to -0.22, respectively), T2D (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79-0.87), lipid-lowering treatment (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86), and coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94), whereas the associations with adult body mass index and body fat (beta, 0.04 and 0.02; per SD change in outcomes and birthweight; 95% CI, 0.03-0.04 and 0.01-0.02, respectively) were positive. The Mendelian randomization analyses indicated inverse causal associations of birthweight with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2-hour glucose, coronary artery disease, and T2D and positive causal association with body mass index but no associations with blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that lower birthweight, used as a proxy for intrauterine growth retardation, is causally related with increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease and T2D. This causal relationship is not mediated by adult obesity or hypertension.",2018,6
"Frayling, Timothy M.; Stoneman, Charli E.","Mendelian randomisation in type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease","CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT","Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension are associated with anthropometric and biomarker traits, including waist-to-hip-ratio, body mass index and altered glucose and insulin levels. Clinical trials, for example of weight-loss interventions, show these factors are causal, but lifelong impact of subtle changes in body mass index and body fat distribution are less clear. The use of human genetics can quantify the causal effects of long-term exposure to subtle changes of modifiable risk factors. Mendelian randomisation (MR) uses human genetic variants associated with the risk factor to quantify the relationship between risk factor and disease outcome. The last two years have seen an increase in the number of MR studies investigating the relationship between anthropometric traits and metabolic diseases. This review provides an overview of these recent MR studies in relation to type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension. MR provides evidence for causal associations of waist-to-hip-ratio, body mass index and altered glucose levels with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension.",2018,6

We conducted a Mendelian randomisation study to investigate whether serum magnesium levels may be causally associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: This Mendelian randomisation analysis is based on summary-level data from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium's 1000 Genomes-based genome-wide association meta-analysis of 48 studies with a total of 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 non-cases. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with serum magnesium levels at genome-wide significance were used as instrumental variables. Results: A genetic predisposition to higher serum magnesium levels was inversely associated with CAD. In conventional Mendelian randomisation analysis, the odds ratio of CAD was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 0.99; P = 0.03) per 0.1-mmol/L (about 1 standard deviation) increase in genetically predicted serum magnesium levels. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses using the weighted median and heterogeneity-penalised model averaging methods, with odds ratios of 0.84 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.98; P = 0.03) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; P = 0.02), respectively. Conclusions: This study based on genetics provides evidence that serum magnesium levels are inversely associated with risk of CAD. Randomised controlled trials elucidating whether magnesium supplementation lowers the risk of CAD, preferably in a setting at higher risk of hypomagnesaemia, are warranted.",2018,6

In this study, we specifically conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to overcome these limitations and test the associations of obesity-related traits (other than body mass index (BMI)) (n = 322,154) with CAD (22,233 cases and 64,762 controls) by using summary-level data from previous studies. The methods utilized to estimate these associations included the inverse-variance weighted method, the weighted median method and MR-Egger regression. Our results supported causal effects of BMI, hip circumference (HC), waist circumference (WC), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on CAD. The associations of BMI-adjusted HC and WC with CAD were reversed, unlike that of WHR. In MR analyses excluding overlapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from obesity-related traits, the associations of these traits with CAD were preserved. The associations of BMI-adjusted HC and WC with CAD require further investigation, as collider stratification may be occurring. Additionally, central adiposity (measured by WHR) separated from general adiposity (measured by BMI) and general adiposity might pose similar risks for CAD. In clinical practice, physicians should pay attention to the potential effects of different obesity-related traits on CAD.",2018,6

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables for childhood BMI to test the causal effect of childhood BMI on cardiometabolic diseases using summary-level data from consortia. RESULTS We found that a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI (kg/m(2)) was associated with an 83% increase in risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.83 [95% CI 1.46, 2.30]; P = 2.5 x 10(-7)) and a 28% increase in risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.17, 1.39]; P = 2.1 x 10(-8)) at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance (P < 0.017) in adults. In addition, a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI was associated with a 0.587-SD increase in adulthood BMI (kg/m(2)), a 0.062-SD increase in hip circumference (cm), a 0.602-SD increase in waist circumference (cm), a 0.111 pmol/L increase in log fasting insulin, a 0.068 increase in log-transformed HOMA of beta-cell function (%), a 0.126 increase in log-transformed HOMA of insulin resistance (%), and a 0.109-SD increase in triglyceride (mg/dL) but a 0.138-SD decrease in HDL (mg/dL) in adults at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance (P < 0.0026).

As measure of alcohol exposure, self-reported consumption and genetic variation in alcohol metabolizing genes (alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1B and ADH1C) as instrumental variables were used. Stroke diagnoses were obtained from a validated hospital register. Results During follow-up 2,535 cases of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke occurred. Low and moderate alcohol intake (1 to 20 drinks/week) was associated with reduced risk of stroke. The hazard ratios associated with drinking 1 to 6, 7 to 13, and 14 to 20 drinks/week were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.76 to 0.92), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.94), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.97), respectively, compared with drinking <1 drink/day. ADH1B and ADH1C genotypes were not associated with risk of stroke. Further analysis to test the included measures revealed that increasing alcohol intake (per 1 drink/day) was positively associated with risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, but not associated with risk of stroke, and that increasing blood pressure (per systolic 10 mm Hg) was not associated with risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, but positively associated with risk of stroke. Conclusions Low and moderate self-reported alcohol intake was associated with reduced risk of stroke. The result was not supported by the result from the causal genetic analysis.",2018,6

The aim of this study was to explore the causal association between determined blood eosinophil count and 20 common complex outcomes (10 metabolic, 6 cardiac, and 4 pulmonary). Through Mendelian randomization, we investigated genetic evidence for the genetically determined eosinophil in association with each outcomes using individual-level LifeLines cohort data (n = 13,301), where a weighted eosinophil genetic risk score comprising five eosinophil associated variants was created. We further examined the associations of the genetically determined eosinophil with those outcomes using summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association study consortia (6 consortia and 14 outcomes). Blood eosinophil count, by a 1-SD genetically increased, was not statistically associated with common complex outcomes in the LifeLines. Using the summary statistics, we showed that a higher genetically determined eosinophil count had a significant association with lower odds of obesity (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.74, 0.89]) but not with the other traits and diseases.

Results One SD higher BMI (similar to 4.5 kg/m(2)) was associated with higher risk of CHD (OR 1.45 [95% CI 1.27, 1.66]) and type 2 diabetes (1.96 [95% CI 1.35, 2.83]), higher levels of fasting glucose (0.07 mmol/l [95% CI 0.03, 0.11]), HbA(1c) (0.05% [95% CI 0.01, 0.08]), fasting insulin (0.18 log pmol/l [95% CI 0.14, 0.22]) and triacylglycerols (0.20 SD [95% CI 0.14, 0.26]) and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (-0.23 SD [95% CI -0.32, -0.15]). There was no evidence for a causal relation between BMI and LDL-cholesterol. The causal associations of higher triacylglycerols, HbA(1c) and diabetes risk with CHD risk remained after performing sensitivity analyses that considered different models of horizontal pleiotropy.

We developed an analytical framework that integrates genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization with epigenome-wide association studies to evaluate the causal relationships between methylation levels and 14 cardiovascular disease traits. We identified ten genetic loci known to influence proximal DNA methylation which were also associated with cardiovascular traits after multiple-testing correction. Bivariate fine mapping provided evidence that the individual variants responsible for the observed effects on cardiovascular traits at the ADCY3 and ADIPOQ loci were potentially mediated through changes in DNA methylation, although we highlight that we are unable to reliably separate causality from horizontal pleiotropy. Estimates of causal effects were replicated with results from large-scale consortia. Genetic variants and CpG sites identified in this study were enriched for histone mark peaks in relevant tissue types and gene promoter regions.

Primary outcomes were blood pressure, hypertension, and ischemic stroke. Median follow-up for incident ischemic stroke was 9.3 years (range, 1 day-33.6 years). DHCR7/CYP2R1 allele score was as expected associated with lower 25(OH) D concentration (F=328 and R-2=1.0%). A genetically determined 10 nmol/L lower 25(OH) D concentration was associated with a 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-1.17) mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure and a 0.36 (95% CI, 0.08-0.63) mm Hg higher diastolic blood pressure with corresponding observational estimates of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.50-0.68) and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.35-0.45) mm Hg. The odds ratio for hypertension was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.97-1.08) for a genetically determined 10 nmol/L lower 25(OH) D with a corresponding observational odds ratio of 1.06 (95% CI, 1.05-1.07). The odds ratio for ischemic stroke was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.86-1.13) for a genetically determined 10 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH) D with a corresponding observational odds ratio of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01-1.05). Genetic and observational low 25(OH) D concentrations were associated with higher blood pressure, as well as with hypertension consistent with causal relationships. Because observational but not genetic low 25(OH) D concentration was associated with ischemic stroke, and as the CIs overlapped, we can neither support nor exclude a causal relationship.",2017,6

DESIGN Mendelian randomisation study, using genetic data as proxies for education to minimise confounding. SETTING The main analysis used genetic data from two large consortia (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D and SSGAC), comprising 112 studies from predominantly high income countries. Findings from mendelian randomisation analyses were then compared against results from traditional observational studies (164 170 participants). Finally, genetic data from six additional consortia were analysed to investigate whether longer education can causally alter the common cardiovascular risk factors. PARTICIPANTS The main analysis was of 543 733 men and women (from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D and SSGAC), predominantly of European origin. EXPOSURE A one standard deviation increase in the genetic predisposition towards higher education (3.6 years of additional schooling), measured by 162 genetic variants that have been previously associated with education. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Combined fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease (63 746 events in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D). RESULTS Genetic predisposition towards 3.6 years of additional education was associated with a one third lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.77; P=3x10(-8)). This was comparable to findings from traditional observational studies (prevalence odds ratio 0.73, 0.68 to 0.78; incidence odds ratio 0.80, 0.76 to 0.83). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with a causal interpretation in which major bias from genetic pleiotropy was unlikely, although this remains an untestable possibility. Genetic predisposition towards longer education was additionally associated with less smoking, lower body mass index, and a favourable blood lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS This mendelian randomisation study found support for the hypothesis that low education is a causal risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease. Potential mechanisms could include smoking, body mass index, and blood lipids. In conjunction with the results from studies with other designs, these findings suggest that increasing education may result in substantial health benefits.",2017,6

Observationally it is positively associated with cardiovascular disease, although these observations could be confounded or due to reverse causation. We assessed ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk by genetically predicted VEGF, ie, using Mendelian randomization. Methods and Results-Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicting VEGF level, at genome-wide significance, were applied to the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes-based genome-wide association study IHD case (n=60 801)-control (n=123 504) study. We obtained unconfounded estimates using instrumental variable analysis by combining the Wald estimates for each SNP using inverse variance weighting and Mendelian randomization-Egger regression. Based on 9 SNPs independently predicting VEGF (rs1740073 [C6orf223], rs2375981 [KCNV2], rs2639990 [ZADH2], rs4782371 [ZFPM1], rs6921438 [LOC100132354], rs7043199 [VLDLR-AS1], rs10761741 [JMJD1C], rs6993770 [ZFPM2], and rs114694170 [MEF2C]), VEGF was unrelated to IHD (odds ratio 0.99 per log-transformed pg/mL, 95% CI 0.96-1.02) using inverse variance weighting. However, Mendelian randomization-Egger regression suggested an inverse relation of VEGF with IHD (odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99), although the association was not evident after excluding the lead SNP (rs6921438) or additionally excluding the pleiotropic SNP (rs6993770). Conclusions-Our study does not provide strong evidence for a positive effect of VEGF on IHD but does not rule out the possibility that some specific types of VEGF, for which genetic predictors have not yet been identified, might play a role.",2017,6

OBJECTIVES To use UK Biobank data to report causal estimates of the association between BMI and cardiometabolic disease outcomes and traits, such as pulse rate, using mendelian randomization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional baseline data from a population-based cohort study including 119 859 UK Biobank participants with complete phenotypic (medical and sociodemographic) and genetic data. Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from May 1 to July 11, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian randomization approach. RESULTS Of the 119 859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years. Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 x 10(-19)), coronary heart disease (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 x 10(-17)), as well as systolic blood pressure (beta = 1.65mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.78-2.52mm Hg; P = 2.0 x 10(-04)) and diastolic blood pressure (beta = 1.37mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.88-1.85mm Hg; P = 3.6 x 10(-08)). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the potential causal association between genetic variants related to elevated serum calcium levels and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction using mendelian randomization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The analyses were performed using summary statistics obtained for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from a genome-wide association meta-analysis of serum calcium levels (N = up to 61 079 individuals) and from the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis Plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics (CardiogramplusC4D) consortium's 1000 genomes-based genome-wide association meta-analysis (N = up to 184 305 individuals) that included cases (individuals with CAD andmyocardial infarction) and noncases, with baseline data collected from 1948 and populations derived from across the globe. The association of each SNP with CAD andmyocardial infarction was weighted by its association with serum calcium, and estimates were combined using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. EXPOSURES Genetic risk score based on genetic variants related to elevated serum calcium levels. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Co-primary outcomes were the odds of CAD and myocardial infarction. RESULTS Among the mendelian randomized analytic sample of 184 305 individuals (60 801 CAD cases [approximately 70% with myocardial infarction] and 123 504 noncases), the 6 SNPs related to serum calcium levels and without pleiotropic associations with potential confounders were estimated to explain about 0.8% of the variation in serum calcium levels. In the inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (combining the estimates of the 6 SNPs), the odds ratios per 0.5-mg/dL increase (about 1 SD) in genetically predicted serum calcium levels were 1.25 (95% CI, 1.08-1.45; P = .003) for CAD and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.05-1.46; P = .009) for myocardial infarction.

However, the relationship between TL and common metabolic risk factors for CHD is not well understood. Whether these risk factors could explain pathways from TL to CHD warrants further attention. Objective: To examine whether metabolic risk factors for CHD mediate the causal pathway from short TL to increased risk of CHD using a network Mendelian randomization design. Methods and Results: Summary statistics from several genome-wide association studies were used in a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study design. Network Mendelian randomization analysis-an approach using genetic variants as the instrumental variables for both the exposure and mediator to infer causality-was performed to examine the causal association between telomeres and CHD and metabolic risk factors. Summary statistics from the ENGAGE Telomere Consortium were used (n=37 684) as a TL genetic instrument, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium data were used (case=22 233 and control=64 762) for CHD, and other consortia data were used for metabolic traits (fasting insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus, glycohemoglobin, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist: hip ratio). One-unit increase of genetically determined TL was associated with -0.07 (95% confidence interval, -0.01 to -0.12; P=0.01) lower log-transformed fasting insulin (pmol/L) and 21% lower odds (95% confidence interval, 3-35; P=0.02) of CHD. Higher genetically determined log-transformed fasting insulin level was associated with higher CHD risk (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-3.41; P=0.04). Conclusions: Overall, our findings support a role of insulin as a mediator on the causal pathway from shorter telomeres to CHD pathogenesis.",2017,6

In this article, we quantify and contrast causal associations of central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index [WHRadjBMI]) and general adiposity (body mass index [BMI]) with cardiometabolic disease. METHODS: Ninety-seven independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms for BMI and 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for WHRadjBMI were used to conduct Mendelian randomization analyses in 14 prospective studies supplemented with coronary heart disease (CHD) data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics; combined total 66 842 cases), stroke from METASTROKE (12 389 ischemic stroke cases), type 2 diabetes mellitus from DIAGRAM (Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis; 34 840 cases), and lipids from GLGC (Global Lipids Genetic Consortium; 213 500 participants) consortia. Primary outcomes were CHD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major stroke subtypes; secondary analyses included 18 cardiometabolic traits. RESULTS: Each one standard deviation (SD) higher WHRadjBMI (1 SD approximate to 0.08 U) associated with a 48% excess risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] for CHD, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.71), similar to findings for BMI (1 SD approximate to 4.6 kg/m(2); OR for CHD, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22-1.52). Only WHRadjBMI increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.70). For type 2 diabetes mellitus, both measures had large effects: OR, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.38-2.42) and OR, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.41-2.78) per 1 SD higher WHRadjBMI and BMI, respectively. Both WHRadjBMI and BMI were associated with higher left ventricular hypertrophy, glycemic traits, interleukin 6, and circulating lipids. WHRadjBMI was also associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness (39%; 95% CI, 9%-77% per 1 SD). CONCLUSIONS: Both general and central adiposity have causal effects on CHD and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Central adiposity may have a stronger effect on stroke risk. Future estimates of the burden of adiposity on health should include measures of central and general adiposity.",2017,6

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary-level statistics from the largest published meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for fasting glucose (FG) (n = 133,010 participants free of diabetes) and CAD (n = 63,746 case subjects and 130,681 control subjects) of predominantly European ancestry. FG-increasing variants associated with type 2 diabetes from the largest GWAS for type 2 diabetes were excluded. Variants with pleiotropic effects on other CAD risk factors (blood lipids, blood pressure, and obesity) were excluded using summary-level data from the largest published GWAS. Data from the Framingham Heart Study were used to validate the MR instrument and to build an FG genetic risk score (GRS). RESULTS In an instrumental variable analysis comprising 12 FG-raising variants, a 1mmol/L increase in FG revealed an effect-size estimate of 1.43 CAD odds (95% CI 1.141.79). The association was preserved after excluding variants for heterogeneity and pleiotropic effects on other CAD risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.33 [95% CI 1.02-1.73]). The 12 FG-increasing variants did not significantly increase type 2 diabetes risk (OR 1.05 [95% CI 0.91-1.23]), and its prevalence was constant across FG GRS quintiles (P = 0.72).

"Xu, Lin; Hao, Yuan Tao","Effect of handgrip on coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction: a Mendelian randomization study","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","Observational studies have reported an association of handgrip strength with risk of cardiovascular disease. However, residual confounding and reverse causation may have influenced these findings. A Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to examine whether handgrip is causally associated with cardiovascular disease. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3121278 and rs752045, were used as the genetic instruments for handgrip. The effect of each SNP on coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (CAD/MI) was weighted by its effect on handgrip strength, and estimates were pooled to provide a summary measure for the effect of increased handgrip on risk of CAD/MI. MR analysis showed that higher grip strength reduces risk for CAD/MI, with 1-kilogram increase in genetically determined handgrip reduced odds of CAD by 6% (odds ratio (OR) = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.99, P = 0.01), and reduced odds of MI by 7% (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.98, P = 0.003). No association of grip strength with type 2 diabetes, body mass index, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting glucose was found.

To clarify, we assessed whether people with genetically higher calcium had a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI) and their risk factors. We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization study. We identified genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) that independently contributed to serum calcium at genome-wide significance which we applied to large extensively genotyped studies of CAD, MI, diabetes, lipids, glycaemic traits and adiposity to obtain unconfounded estimates, with body mass index (BMI) as a control outcome. Based on 4 SNPs each 1 mg/dl increase in calcium was positively associated with CAD (odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.17), MI (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06-2.35), LDL-cholesterol (0.21 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.01-0.4), total cholesterol (0.21 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.03-0.38) and possibly triglycerides (0.19 standard deviations, 95% CI -0.1-0.48), but was unlikely related to BMI although the estimate lacked precision. Sensitivity analysis using 13 SNPs showed a higher risk for CAD (OR 1.87, 95% CI-1.14-3.08). Our findings, largely consistent with the experimental evidence, suggest higher serum calcium may increase the risk of CAD.",2017,6

Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain. Objective To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes. Design, Setting, and Participants A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322 154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111 986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149 821 individuals and 184 305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank. Exposures Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI. Main Outcomes and Measures Type 2 diabetes and CHD. Results Among 111 986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58 845 participants (52.5%) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P < .001). A 1-SD genetic increase in WHR adjusted for BMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.57-2.00]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 6.0 [95% CI, CI, 4.4-7.8]; number of participants with type 2 diabetes outcome, 40 530) and CHD (odds ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.32-1.62]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.4]; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66 440). Conclusions and Relevance A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.",2017,6

M.","Homocysteine-reducing B vitamins and ischemic heart disease: a separate- sample Mendelian randomization analysis","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Observationally, homocysteine is positively associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and unhealthy lipids; folate and vitamin B12, which reduce homocysteine, are associated with lower IHD risk and healthy lipids. Randomized controlled trials have shown no benefits of folate and vitamin B12 for IHD. To clarify the role of these potential targets of intervention in IHD we assessed how genetically determined homocysteine, folate and vitamin-B12-affected IHD and lipids. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Separate-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments, that is, Mendelian randomization, was used to obtain unconfounded estimates (based on strongly related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) using CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, a large coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (CAD/MI) case (n = 64 374)-control (n = 130 681) study with extensive genotyping, and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n = 196 475). RESULTS: Homocysteine was unrelated to CAD/MI (odds ratio (OR) 1.07 per log-transformed s. d., 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.19) based on 14 SNPs, as was folate (OR 1.18 per s. d., 95% CI 0.80 to 1.75) based on rs153734, and vitamin B12 (OR 0.98 per logtransformed s. d., 95% CI 0.85 to 1.14) based on rs602662, rs9473555, rs526934 and rs11254363. Homocysteine and folate were not clearly associated with lipids, vitamin B12 was associated with higher inverse normal transformed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12) and triglycerides (0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not corroborate the observed positive association of homocysteine or negative associations of folate and vitamin B12 with CAD/MI. Vitamin B12 might be associated with an unfavorable lipid profile.",2017,6

Associations with lipids and diabetes were similarly assessed to rule out effects via traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Separate sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments (Mendelian randomisation) was used to obtain an unconfounded estimate of the association of protein C (based on (rs867186 (PROCR), rs3746429 (EDEM2), rs7580658 (inter/PROC)) with CAD/MI in an extensively genotyped case (n=64374)-control (n=130681) study, CARDloGRAMplusC4D. Associations with lipids and diabetes were similarly assessed using the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n=196,475) and the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis case (n=34,380) -control (n=114,981) study. Genetically predicted protein C was negatively associated with CAD/MI, odds ratio (OR) 0,85 mu g/ml, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.90, but had no such negative association with lipids or diabetes.

Mendelian randomization (MR) provides less confounded results. We used MR analysis to assess the associations of ALT (U/L) with IHD, diabetes and other CVD risk factors. We used instrumental variable analysis based on two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) HSD17B13/MAPK10 (rs6834314) and PNPLA3/SAMM50 (rs738409) to assess the associations of ALT (U/L) with IHD, diabetes and other CVD risk factors in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). Observationally in 19,925 participants ALT levels were strongly positively associated with self-reported IHD, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein-and total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, body mass index, waist circumference, heart rate (HR) and diabetes, but were not associated with uncorrected QT interval, HR-corrected QT interval or high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In the MR study, using a credible genetic instrument (F-statistic - 23) for ALT, ALT levels were negatively associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.97) and triglycerides (beta - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.13 to - 0.03), but were not associated with other CVD risk factors.

L-arginine is thought to increase nitric oxide and be cardioprotective, whereas ADMA and SDMA may inhibit nitric oxide synthesis and increase cardiovascular disease risk. Unexpectedly, L-arginine increased mortality in a small trial. To clarify the effects of these potential targets of intervention, we assessed the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) by genetically determined L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA. Methods Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contributing to L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA, at genome-wide significance, were applied to the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes-based genome-wide association study IHD case (n = 60,801, similar to 70% myocardial infarction)-control (n = 123,504) study. We obtained unconfounded estimates using instrumental variable analysis by combining the Wald estimators for each SNP, taking into account any correlation between SNPs using weighted generalized linear regression. Results Higher L-arginine was associated with higher risk of IHD (odds ratio [OR] 1.18 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.03-1.36) and of myocardial infarction (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10-1.51), based on 2 SNPs from MED23.

"Zhao, Jie V.; Schooling, C. Mary","Endogenous androgen exposures and ischemic heart disease, a separate sample Mendelian randomization study","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY","Background: Evolutionary biology suggests growth and reproduction trade-off against longevity. Correspondingly estrogen supplementation failed to increase lifespan. Testosterone supplementation is widely used by older men, although regulators have warned of its cardiovascular risk. No large trial of testosterone exists. We examined how genetic determinants of up-regulation (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) and down-regulation (anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS)) of mainly the male reproductive system are associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD). Methods: Separate sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments, i.e., Mendelian randomization, was used to obtain unconfounded estimates using large case-control studies of coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (CAD/MI) with extensive genotyping, i.e., CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (64,374 CAD/MI cases, 130,681controls), or CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes (60,801 cases, 123,504 controls). Results: Genetically predicted FSH was positively associated with CAD/MI (odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.13 per mIU/mL FSH). Genetically predicted AMH and TDS were inversely associated with CAD/MI (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.998 per ng/mL log AMH and OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98 per log OR higher risk of TDS). Conclusions: As expected from evolutionary biology, genetically predicted FSH, related to higher androgens in men and women, was positively associated with IHD, while genetically predicted AMH and TDS, related to lower androgens in men, were inversely associated with IHD. Androgens might be a modifiable causal factor underlying men's greater vulnerability to IHD, with corresponding implications for use of testosterone supplementation as well as for prevention and treatment of IHD.

In up to 910 elderly men we found associations of 52 metabolites with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp-measured IR and/or beta-cell responsiveness (disposition index) during an oral glucose tolerance test. These implicated bile acid, glycerophospholipid and caffeine metabolism for IR and fatty acid biosynthesis for impaired insulin secretion. In MR analysis in two separate cohorts (n = 2,613) followed by replication in three independent studies profiled on different metabolomics platforms (n = 7,824 / 8,961 / 8,330), we discovered and replicated causal effects of IR on lower levels of palmitoleic acid and oleic acid. A trend for a causal effect of IR on higher levels of tyrosine reached significance only in meta-analysis. In one of the largest studies combining ""gold standard"" measures for insulin responsiveness with non-targeted metabolomics, we found distinct metabolic profiles related to IR or impaired insulin secretion.

Lowering of LDL-C levels by statin therapy modestly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, but it is unknown whether this effect is specific to statins. OBJECTIVE To investigate the associations of 3 routinely measured lipid fractions with CAD and diabetes through mendelian randomization (MR) using conventional MR and making use of newer approaches, such as multivariate MR and MR-Egger, that address the pleiotropy of genetic instruments where relevant. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Published data from genome-wide association studies were used to construct genetic instruments and then applied to investigate associations between lipid fractions and the risk of CAD and diabetes using MR approaches that took into account pleiotropy of genetic instruments. The study was conducted from March 12 to December 31, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary artery disease and diabetes. RESULTS Genetic instruments composed of 130 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used for LDL-C (explaining 7.9% of its variance), 140 SNPs for HDL-C (6.6% of variance), and 140 SNPs for TGs (5.9% of variance). A 1-SD genetically instrumented elevation in LDL-C levels (equivalent to 38 mg/dL) and TG levels (equivalent to 89 mg/dL) was associated with higher CAD risk; odds ratios (ORs) were 1.68 (95% CI, 1.51-1.87) for LDL-C and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.13-1.45) for TGs. The corresponding OR for HDL-C (equivalent to a 16-mg/dL increase) was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.85-1.06). All 3 lipid traits were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The ORs were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71-0.88) for LDL-C and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90) for HDL-C per 1-SD elevation. For TG, the MR estimates for diabetes were inconsistent, with MR-Egger giving an OR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.95) per 1-SD elevation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Routinely measured lipid fractions exhibit contrasting associations with the risk of CAD and diabetes. Increased LDL-C, HDL-C, and possibly TG levels are associated with a lower risk of diabetes.

It is unclear whether this relationship is causal, arises from residual confounding, and/or is a consequence of reverse causation. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is causally related to CVD in the general population. METHODS We incorporated participant data from 16 prospective cohorts (n = 76,481) with 37,126 measures of cystatin C and added genetic data from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with 63,292 CVD events. We used the common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental variable to investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. RESULTS Cystatin C concentrations were associated with CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional risk factors (relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 x 10(-14)). The minor allele of rs911119 was associated with decreased serum cystatin C (6.13% per allele; 95% CI: 5.75 to 6.50; p = 5.95 x 10(-211)), explaining 2.8% of the observed variation in cystatin C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not provide evidence fora causal role of cystatin C, with a causal relative risk for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.22; p = 0,994), which was statistically different from the observational estimate (p = 1.6 x 10(-5)). A causal effect of cystatin C was not detected for any individual component of CVD. CONCLUSIONS Mendelian randomization analyses did not support a causal role of cystatin C in the etiology of CVD. As such, therapeutics targeted at lowering circulating cystatin C are unlikely to be effective in preventing CVD. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, it is unknown whether adiponectin is causally implicated in CHD pathogenesis. Objective: We aimed to investigate the causal effect of adiponectin on CHD risk. Methods and Results: We undertook a Mendelian randomization study using data from genome-wide association studies consortia. We used the ADIPOGen consortium to identify genetic variants that could be used as instrumental variables for the effect of adiponectin. Data on the association of these genetic variants with CHD risk were obtained from CARDIoGRAM (22 233 CHD cases and 64 762 controls of European ancestry) and from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Metabochip (63 746 cases and 130 681 controls; approximate to 91% of European ancestry) consortia. Data on the association of genetic variants with adiponectin levels and with CHD were combined to estimate the influence of blood adiponectin on CHD risk. In the conservative approach (restricted to using variants within the adiponectin gene as instrumental variables), each 1 U increase in log blood adiponectin concentration was associated with an odds ratio for CHD of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.01) in CARDIoGRAM and 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.12) in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Metabochip. Findings from the liberal approach (including variants in any locus across the genome) indicated a protective effect of adiponectin that was attenuated to the null after adjustment for known CHD predictors. Conclusions: Overall, our findings do not support a causal role of adiponectin levels in CHD pathogenesis.",2016,6

The first GRS consisted of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene (GRS(CRP)), and the second consisted of 18 SNPs that were significantly associated with CRP levels in the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date (GRS(GWAS)). To optimize power, we used summary statistics from GWAS consortia and tested the association of these two GRSs with 32 complex somatic and psychiatric outcomes, with up to 123,865 participants per outcome from populations of European ancestry. We performed heterogeneity tests to disentangle the pleiotropic effect of IVs. A Bonferroni-corrected significance level of less than 0.0016 was considered statistically significant. An observed p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered nominally significant evidence for a potential causal association, yet to be confirmed. The strengths (F-statistics) of the IVs were 31.92-3,761.29 and 82.32-9,403.21 for GRS(CRP) and GRS(GWAS), respectively. CRP GRS(GWAS) showed a statistically significant protective relationship of a 10% genetically elevated CRP level with the risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.94]; p < 0.001). We validated this finding with individual-level genotype data from the schizophrenia GWAS (OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.94-0.98]; p < 1.72 x 10(-6)). Further, we found that a standardized CRP polygenic risk score (CRPPRS) at p-value thresholds of 1 x 10(-4), 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 using individual-level data also showed a protective effect (OR < 1.00) against schizophrenia; the first CRPPRS (built of SNPs with p < 1 x 10(-4)) showed a statistically significant (p < 2.45 x 10(-4)) protective effect with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99). The CRP GRS(GWAS) showed that a 10% increase in genetically determined CRP level was significantly associated with coronary artery disease (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.84-0.94]; p < 2.4 x 10(-5)) and was nominally associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 0.85 [95% CI 0.74-0.98]; p < 0.03), Crohn disease (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70-0.94]; p < 0.005), psoriatic arthritis (OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.00-1.84]; p < 0.049), knee osteoarthritis (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.01-1.36]; p < 0.04), and bipolar disorder (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.05-1.40]; p < 0.007) and with an increase of 0.72 (95% CI 0.11-1.34; p < 0.02) mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, 0.45 (95% CI 0.06-0.84; p < 0.02) mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure, 0.01 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (95% CI 0.003-0.02; p < 0.005) in estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine, 0.01 g/dl (95% CI 0.0004-0.02; p < 0.04) in serum albumin level, and 0.03 g/dl (95% CI 0.008-0.05; p < 0.009) in serum protein level. However, after adjustment for heterogeneity, neither GRS showed a significant effect of CRP level (at p < 0.0016) on any of these outcomes, including coronary artery disease, nor on the other 20 complex outcomes studied. Our study has two potential limitations: the limited variance explained by our genetic instruments modeling CRP levels in blood and the unobserved bias introduced by the use of summary statistics in our MR analyses. Conclusions Genetically elevated CRP levels showed a significant potentially protective causal relationship with risk of schizophrenia. We observed nominal evidence at an observed p < 0.05 using either GRS(CRP) or GRS(GWAS)-with persistence after correction for heterogeneity-for a causal relationship of elevated CRP levels with psoriatic osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, knee osteoarthritis, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and bipolar disorder. These associations remain yet to be confirmed. We cannot verify any causal effect of CRP level on any of the other common somatic and neuropsychiatric outcomes investigated in the present study. This implies that interventions that lower CRP level are unlikely to result in decreased risk for the majority of common complex outcomes.",2016,6

Mary","Genetically predicted 17beta-estradiol and cardiovascular risk factors in women: a Mendelian randomization analysis using young women in Hong Kong and older women in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study","ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY","Purpose: The role of estrogen in cardiovascular health remains contested with discrepancies between findings from randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Mendelian randomization, which assesses the effect of lifelong endogenous exposure, may help elucidate these discrepancies. Methods: We used separate sample instrumental variable analysis to estimate the association of log 17 beta-estradiol with factors related to cardiovascular disease risk (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipids, fasting glucose, body mass index, waist hip ratio, and waist circumference) and Framingham score, a predictor of 10-year risk of ischemic heart disease events, in older Chinese women from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS, n = 3092). The estimate was derived using the Wald estimator, that is, the ratio of the association of genetic determinants (rs1008805 and rs2175898) of log 17 beta-estradiol with cardiovascular disease risk factors and Framingham score in GBCS and the association of these genetic determinants with log 17 beta-estradiol in a sample of young women from Hong Kong (n = 236). Results: Genetically, higher 17 beta-estradiol was not associated with any cardiovascular disease-related risk factor or with Framingham score (-0.01, 95% confidence interval = -1.34 to 1.31). Conclusions: Lifetime exposure to estrogen does not appear to be cardioprotective via the cardiovascular disease-related risk factors examined. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2016,6

Mary","Birth weight and adult cardiovascular risk factors using multiple birth status as an instrumental variable in the 1958 British Birth Cohort","PREVENTIVE MEDICINE","Background. Birth weight is classified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease by the World Health Organization, but appropriate preventive interventions remain unclear because the observations have not been confirmed in experiments and appear to be contextually specific. Methods. Using 9452 participants of the 1958 British Birth Cohort at age 42 years in 2000 (58% follow-up), we examined the credibility of multiple birth status as an instrumental variable (IV) for birth weight and, if appropriate, use it to obtain less confounded estimates of the associations of birth weight with cardiovascular disease risk factors including self-reported height, body mass index and hypertension than conventional regression in 2014. Results. Multiple birth (203 twins and 6 triplets) was associated with older maternal age, but not with paternal occupation or maternal smoking. Multiple births had lower birth weight-for-gestational age z-score. Multiple birth status was not directly associated with height, BMI or hypertension. Using IV estimates birth weight-for-gestational age z-score was not clearly associated with height (0.99 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.27, 2.25), body mass index (BMI) (0.42 kg/m(2), 95% CI - 0.17, 1.01) or hypertension (risk ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.54, 1.23) adjusted for maternal age, with a first-stage F statistic of 145.3 from IV analysis. Conclusions. Multiple birth status is a credible IV for obtaining a less confounded estimate of the association of birth weight with height, BMI and blood pressure. Such analysis suggests that birth weight may be spuriously related to height, BMI and blood pressure, and thus not an effective target for intervention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The absence of associations of genetic variants (e.g. rs671 in ALDH2) with such risk factors in women - who drank little in these populations -provides evidence that the observations are not due to genetic pleiotropy. Here, we present a Mendelian randomisation study in a South Korean population (3,365 men and 3,787 women) that 1) provides robust evidence that alcohol consumption adversely affects several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure, waist to hip ratio, fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels. Alcohol also increases HDL cholesterol and lowers LDL cholesterol. Our study also 2) replicates sex differences in associations which suggests pleiotropy does not underlie the associations, 3) provides further evidence that association is not due to pleiotropy by showing null effects in male non-drinkers, and 4) illustrates a way to measure population-level association where alcohol intake is stratified by sex. In conclusion, population-level instrumental variable estimation (utilizing interaction of rs671 in ALDH2 and sex as an instrument) strengthens causal inference regarding the largely adverse influence of alcohol intake on cardiovascular health in an Asian population.",2015,6

We used two common genetic variants in the fetuin-A gene (AHSG) that are strongly associated with circulating fetuin-A levels to investigate the associations with risk of CHD and subclinical cardiovascular measures (intima-media thickness, ankle-arm index, and coronary artery calcification). Methods: Genetic variation and fetuin-A levels were assessed in 3299 community-living individuals (2733 Caucasians and 566 African Americans) 65 years of age or older, free of previous cardiovascular disease, who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) in 1992-1993. Results: Among Caucasians, both rs2248690 and rs4917 were associated with 12% lower fetuin-A concentrations per minor allele (P < 0.0001). The hazard ratios (HRs) per minor allele for incident CHD were 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00-1.26) for rs2248690 and 1.02 (0.91-1.14) for rs4917. Using both genotypes as an instrumental variable for measured fetuin-A, the HRs for one standard deviation increase in genetically determined fetuin-A levels on CHD risk were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70-1.00) for rs2248690 and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.82-1.14) for rs4917, respectively. However, in CHS neither of the genotypes were associated with subclinical cardiovascular measures and when CHS data were meta-analyzed with data from six other prospective studies (totaling 26,702 Caucasian participants and 3295 CHD cases), the meta-analyzed HRs for incident CHD were 1.12 (0.93-1.34) and 1.06 (0.93-1.20) for rs2248690 and rs4917, respectively (p heterogeneity 0.005 and 0.0048). Conclusion: Common variants in the AHSG gene are strongly associated with fetuin-A levels, but their concurrent association with CHD risk in current prospective studies is inconsistent. Further investigation in studies with measured fetuin-A and AHSG variants is needed to clarify the potential causal association of fetuin-A with CHD risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Prevalence rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, CKD, and cardiovascular disease are also increasing. We used Mendelian randomization to examine whether uric acid is an independent and causal cardiovascular risk factor. Serum uric acid was measured in 3315 patients of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiov.ascular Health Study. We calculated a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) for uric acid concentration based on eight uric acid regulating single nucleotide polymorphisms. Causal odds ratios and causal hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a two-stage regression estimate with the GRS as the instrumental variable to examine associations with cardiometabolic phenotypes (cross-sectional) and mortality (prospectively) by logistic regression and Cox regression, respectively. Our GRS was not consistently associated with any biochemical marker except for uric acid, arguing against pleiotropy. Uric acid was associated with a range of prevalent diseases, including coronary artery disease. Uric acid and the GRS were both associated with cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death. In a multivariate model adjusted for factors including medication, causal HRs corresponding to each 1-mg/dl increase in genetically predicted uric acid concentration were significant for cardiovascular death (HR, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.81) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 5.00).

Bile acid sequestrants (BAS) reduce LDL-C, yet their clinical efficacy on CAD remains controversial. Methods and Results We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effect of cholestyramine and colesevelam. We then used Mendelian randomization to estimate the effect of BAS on reducing the risk of CAD. First, we quantified the effect of rs4299376 (ABCG5/ABCG8), which affects the intestinal cholesterol absorption pathway targeted by BAS and then we used these estimates to predict the effect of BAS on CAD. Nineteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 7021 study participants were included. Cholestyramine 24 g/d was associated with a reduction in LDL-C of 23.5 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI] -26.8,-20.2; N=3806) and a trend toward reduced risk of CAD (odds ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-1.02; P=0.07; N=3806), whereas colesevelam 3.75 g/d was associated with a reduction in LDL-C of 22.7 mg/dL (95% CI -28.3, -17.2; N=759). Based on the findings that rs4299376 was associated with a 2.75 mg/dL decrease in LDL-C and a 5% decrease in risk of CAD outcomes, we estimated that cholestyramine was associated with an odds ratio for CAD of 0.63 (95% CI 0.52-0.77; P=6.3x10(-6)) and colesevelam with an odds ratio of 0.64 (95% CI 0.52-0.79, P=4.3x10(-5)), which were not statistically different from BAS clinical trials (P>0.05).

However, the absence of a clear reduction in CAD by intensive glucose lowering in randomized controlled trials has fuelled uncertainty regarding the causal role of dysglycaemia and CAD. Objective To assess whether Mendelian randomization supports a causal role of dysglycaemia and diabetes for risk of CAD. Methods Effect size estimates of common genetic variants associated with fasting glucose (FG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), and diabetes were obtained from the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium and Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-Analysis consortia. The corresponding effect estimates of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of CAD were then evaluated in CARDIOGRAMplusC4D. Results SNPs associated with HbA(1c) and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of CAD. Using information from 59 genetic variants associated with diabetes, the causal effect of diabetes on the risk of CAD was estimated at an odds ratio (OR) of 1.63 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.23-2.07; P = 0.002). On the other hand, nine genetic variants associated with HbA(1c) were associated with an OR of 1.53 per 1% HbA(1c) increase (95% CI: 1.14-2.05; P = 0.023) in the risk of CAD while this effect was non-significant among 30 genetic variants associated with FG per mmol/L (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.97-1.42; P = 0.102). No significant differences were observed when categorizing genetic loci according to their effect on either beta-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance. Conclusions These Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role for diabetes and its associated high glucose levels on CAD, and suggest that long-term glucose lowering may reduce CAD events.",2015,6

Aim The aim of our study was to assess whether there is a causal relationship between plasma concentration of cystatin C and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) using a Mendelian Randomization approach. Methods We estimated the strength of association of plasma cystatin C on CAD risk and the strength of association of the strongest GWAS derived cystatin C SNP (rs13038305) on plasma cystatin C in the population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDC) and thereafter the association between rs13038305 and CAD in the MDC (3200 cases of CAD and 24418 controls) and CARDIOGRAM (22233 cases of CAD and 64762 controls). Results Each standard deviation (SD) increment of plasma cystatin C was associated with increased risk of CAD (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.34) after full adjustment. Each copy of the major allele of rs13038305 was associated with 0.34 SD higher plasma concentration of cystatin C (P<1 x 10(-35)), resulting in a power of >98% to detect a significant relationship between rs13038305 and CAD in MDC and CARDIOGRAM pooled. The odds ratio for CAD (per copy of the major rs13038305 allele) was 1.00 (0.94-1.07); P = 0.92 in MDC, 0.99 (0.96-1.03); P = 0.84 in CARDIOGRAM and 1.00 (0.97-1.03); P = 0.83 in MDC and CARDIOGRAM pooled. Conclusion Genetic elevation of plasma cystatin C is not related to altered risk of CAD, suggesting that there is no causal relationship between plasma cystatin C and CAD. Rather, the association between cystatin C and CAD appears to be due to the association of eGFR and CAD.",2015,6

We aimed to test whether genetic predisposition to increased type-I IFN production affects risk of coronary artery disease. Approach and Results-Using a list of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the results of genome-wide association studies for systemic lupus erythematosus, which we hypothesised would be enriched in variants that regulate type-I IFN production, we identified a genetic risk score based on 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10516487, rs3131379 and rs7574865), which correlated significantly with production of IFN-a by human peripheral leukocytes stimulated with CpG-oligonucleotide (n= 60, P= 1.50x10(-5)). These single nucleotide polymorphisms explained 27.8% of variation in the CpG-oligonucleotide-induced IFN-alpha response and were also associated with Toll-like receptor-7/8- and Toll-like receptor-9-dependent IFN-alpha and IFN-beta responses, but were not associated with inflammatory cytokine production in response to Toll-like receptor-4 stimulation or risk of coronary artery disease in 22 233 cases and 64 762 controls (odds ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.98-1.02) using Mendelian randomization-based analyses. Coronary artery disease risk was also not associated with the full panel of 11 systemic lupus erythematosus single nucleotide polymorphisms or loci responsible for the monogenic type-I interferonopathies Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation. Conclusions-The results argue against the potential utility of drugs targeting type-I IFN production for coronary artery disease. The use of genetic variants that modify leukocyte signaling pathways, rather than circulating biomarkers, as instruments in Mendelian randomization analyses may be useful for studies investigating causality of other candidate pathways of atherogenesis.",2015,6

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that genetically high concentrations of plasma vitamin C, such as with high intake of fruit and vegetables, are associated with low risk of ischemic heart disease and all-cause mortality. Design: We used a Mendelian randomization approach and genotyped for solute carrier family 23 member 1 (SLC23A1) rs33972313 in the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 1 in 97,203 white individuals of whom 10,123 subjects had ischemic heart disease, and 8477 subjects died. We measured plasma vitamin C in 3512 individuals and included dietary information on 83,256 individuals. Results: The SLC23A1 rs33972313 G allele was associated with 11% higher plasma vitamin C. The multivariable adjusted HRs for highest compared with lowest fruit and vegetable intakes were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97; P = 0.01) for ischemic heart disease and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88; P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality. Corresponding HRs for rs33972313 GG (93%) compared with AA plus AG (7%) genotypes were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.02; P = 0.21) and 0.96 (0.88, 1.03; P = 0.29), respectively. In an instrumental variable analysis, the OR for genetically determined 25% higher plasma vitamin C concentrations was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.08; P = 0.27) for ischemic heart disease and 0.88 (0.72, 1.08; P = 0.22) for all-cause mortality. Conclusions: High intake of fruit and vegetables was associated with low risk of ischemic heart disease and all-cause mortality. Although the 95% CI for genetically high plasma vitamin C concentrations overlapped 1.0, which made certain statistical inferences difficult, effect sizes were comparable to those for fruit and vegetable intake. Thus, judging by the effect size, our data cannot exclude that a favorable effect of high intake of fruit and vegetables could in part be driven by high vitamin C concentrations.",2015,6

We tested the hypothesis that milk intake observationally and genetically through the LCT-13910 C/T genotype is associated with risk of IHD and MI in a Mendelian randomization design. Methods: We included 98 529 White individuals of Danish descent, aged 20-100 years, from three studies of the general population. Information on IHD (N = 10 372) and MI (N = 4188) were obtained from national Danish registries. First, we investigated observational associations between milk intake and incident IHD and MI. Second, we confirmed the association between the rs4988235 genetic variant LCT-13910 C/T, associated with lactase persistence/non-persistence, and milk intake. Finally, we tested whether LCT-13910 C/T genotype was associated with risk of IHD and MI as well as with cardiovascular risk factors. Results: During a mean follow-up time of 5.4 years, the observational hazard ratio for a 1 glass/week higher milk intake was 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00,1.01] for both IHD and MI. Median milk intake was 3 glasses/week (interquartile range: 0-7) in lactase CC non-persistent individuals compared with 5 glasses/week (0-10) in lactase TC/TT persistent individuals (P = 3*10(-60)). In the dominant genetic model comparing lactase TC/TT persistent individuals with lactase CC non-persistent individuals, the odds ratio was 1.00 (0.92,1.09) for IHD and 0.96 (0.84,1.09) for MI.

In instrumental variable analysis, the odds ratio for ischaemic heart disease for a genetically 25-nmol/l decrease in p-25(OH)D was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.76-1.26), with a corresponding observational hazard ratio by Cox regression of 1.07 (1.01-1.13). Similarly, with myocardial infarction as the outcome, observational analyses suggested an increased risk with lower 25(OH)D, whereas genetic analyses suggested no causal effect. For APOE genotype, the odds ratio for ischaemic heart disease for a 1-mmol/l genetic increase in plasma total cholesterol concentrations was 1.23 (1.08-1.41), with a corresponding observational hazard ratio of 1.08 (1.04-1.14). Conclusion: We found no evidence to suggest that genetically reduced p-25(OH)D is associated with increased risk of ischaemic heart disease or myocardial infarction.",2015,6

We aimed to investigate if these associations are causal, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. Methods: The associations of BMI with cardiovascular outcomes [coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure and ischaemic stroke], and associations of a genetic score (32 BMI single nucleotide polymorphisms) with BMI and cardiovascular outcomes were examined in up to 22 193 individuals with 3062 incident cardiovascular events from nine prospective follow-up studies within the ENGAGE consortium. We used random-effects meta-analysis in an MR framework to provide causal estimates of the effect of adiposity on cardiovascular outcomes. Results: There was a strong association between BMI and incident CHD (HR = 1.20 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-1.28, P = 1.9.10(-7)), heart failure (HR = 1.47, 95% CI, 1.35-1.60, P = 9.10(-19)) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06-1.24, P = 0.0008) in observational analyses. The genetic score was robustly associated with BMI (beta = 0.030 SD-increase of BMI per additional allele, 95% CI, 0.028-0.033, P = 3.10(-107)). Analyses indicated a causal effect of adiposity on development of heart failure (HR = 1.93 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-3.30, P = 0.017) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.05-3.20, P = 0.034). Additional cross-sectional analyses using both ENGAGE and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data showed a causal effect of adiposity on CHD.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with several cardiometabolic phenotypes. Shared genetic backgrounds may partially underlie these associations. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify the shared genetic background of inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes using published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We also evaluated whether the pleiotropic effects of such loci were biological or mediated in nature. First, we examined whether 283 common variants identified for 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes in GWAS are associated with CRP level. Second, we tested whether 18 variants identified for serum CRP are associated with 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes. We used a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 1.1x10(-04) (0.05/463) as a threshold of significance. We evaluated the independent pleiotropic effect on both phenotypes using individual level data from the Women Genome Health Study. Evaluating the genetic overlap between inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes, we found 13 pleiotropic regions. Additional analyses showed that 6 regions (APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A and IL1F10) appeared to have a pleiotropic effect on CRP independent of the effects on the cardiometabolic phenotypes. These included loci where individuals carrying the risk allele for CRP encounter higher lipid levels and risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, 5 regions (GCKR, PABPC4, BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18) had an effect on CRP largely mediated through the cardiometabolic phenotypes. In conclusion, our results show genetic pleiotropy among inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes. In addition to reverse causation, our data suggests that pleiotropic genetic variants partially underlie the association between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes.",2015,6

Methods and results We developed weighted allele scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with established associations with HDL-C, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). For each trait, we constructed two scores. The first was unrestricted, including all independent SNPs associated with the lipid trait identified from a priormeta-analysis (threshold P < 2 x 10(-6)); and the second a restricted score, filtered to remove any SNPs also associated with either of the other two lipid traits at P <= 0.01. Mendelian randomization meta-analyses were conducted in 17 studies including 62,199 participants and 12,099 CHD events. Both the unrestricted and restricted allele scores for LDL-C (42 and 19 SNPs, respectively) associated with CHD. For HDL-C, the unrestrictedallele score (48SNPs) was associated with CHD(OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.70), per 1 mmol/L higher HDL-C, but neither the restricted allele score (19 SNPs; OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.98) nor the unrestricted HDL-C allele score adjusted for triglycerides, LDL-C, or statin use (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.46) showed a robust association. For triglycerides, the unrestricted allele score (67 SNPs) and the restricted allele score (27 SNPs) were both associated with CHD (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.11 and 1.61; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.59, respectively) per 1-log unit increment. However, the unrestricted triglyceride score adjusted for HDL-C, LDL-C, and statin use gave an OR for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.75).

Utilizing genome-wide genotyping in the same subjects, we used mendelian randomization methods to assess whether observed associations were incidental or causal.Results:During a mean follow-up of 9 years, 301 participants experienced incident IS. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, HDL-C 40 mg/dL and TC/HDL ratio 5 were associated with increased risk of IS (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.59 [1.23-2.05], p < 0.001 and 1.47 [1.15-1.87], p < 0.001), but not TC or LDL-C. In adjusted analysis, a strong association between TG and IS was diminished. In the MI-free sample (n = 5,875, aged 64 +/- 10 years, 58% female; 403 MI events), all lipid markers were associated with MI risk. A genetic risk score comprising 47 known determinants of circulating HDL-C was not associated with IS.Conclusions:In a middle-aged to elderly community sample, we observed that low HDL-C and high TC/HDL-C ratio, but not LDL-C or TG were associated with risk of incident IS. We observed the usual associations between lipids and risk of MI. Our findings suggest an important, but less likely causal, role of HDL-C over other lipid biomarkers for optimal stroke risk stratification.",2015,6

Design: Mendelian randomisation meta-analyses using a genetic variant (rs16969968/rs1051730 in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene region) as a proxy for smoking heaviness, of the associations of smoking heaviness with a range of adiposity phenotypes. Participants: 148 731 current, former and neversmokers of European ancestry aged >= 16 years from 29 studies in the consortium for Causal Analysis Research in Tobacco and Alcohol (CARTA). Primary outcome measures: Waist and hip circumferences, and waist-hip ratio. Results: The data included up to 66 809 never-smokers, 43 009 former smokers and 38 913 current daily cigarette smokers. Among current smokers, for each extra minor allele, the geometric mean was lower for waist circumference by -0.40% (95% Cl -0.57% to - 0.22%), with effects on hip circumference, waist-hip ratio and body mass index (BMI) being -0.31% (95% Cl - 0.42% to -0.19), -0.08% (-0.19% to 0.03%) and - 0.74% (-0.96% to -0.51%), respectively. In contrast, among never-smokers, these effects were higher by 0.23% (0.09% to 0.36%), 0.17% (0.08% to 0.26%), 0.07% (-0.01% to 0.15%) and 0.35% (0.18% to 0.52%), respectively.

We used a Mendelian randomization approach to study whether these associations may be causal. If smoking affects cardiovascular risk factors then rs1051730 T alleles, predictors of increased smoking quantity, should be associated with cardiovascular risk factors among smokers, but not among never smokers. Methods: Among 56 625 participants of a population-based study, we estimated associations of rs1051730 T alleles with cardiovascular risk factors and examined whether the associations differed by smoking status. Results: Rs1051730 T alleles were associated with lower BMI and waist and hip circumferences and higher resting heart rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the associations were strongest among current smokers (P interaction 5 x 10(-9) to 0.01). Rs1051730 T alleles were associated with lower systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and higher HDL cholesterol concentrations, but these associations did not robustly differ by smoking status. There were no convincing associations of rs1051730 T alleles with waist-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure and non-fasting serum concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and C-reactive protein. Conclusions: This Mendelian randomization analysis provides evidence that smoking may cause lower BMI and waist and hip circumferences and higher resting heart rate and eGFR. The findings further suggest that smoking is not a major determinant of waist-hip ratio or adverse blood pressure, serum lipid or glucose levels.",2014,6

We examined the association between SHBG and cardiovascular risk factors, independently of total testosterone (TT), in young men. Design: Observational, cross-sectional study. Setting: General community. Participants: The study included 2716 men aged 31 years in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort in 1996 with clinical examination data and fasting blood samples. Outcome variables: Blood pressure (BP), lipids and C-reactive protein (CRP) as biological CVD risk markers. Results: SHBG concentration was significantly and inversely related to systolic and diastolic BP, triglycerides and CRP, but positively to HDL cholesterol after adjusting for insulin, BMI, waist circumference, smoking, education and physical activity (all P< 0.05). These linearly graded associations persisted with additional adjustment for TT. SHBG was significantly associated with total cholesterol only with adjustment for covariates and TT (P<0.05). The direction and magnitude of associations between TT and risk factors were variable, but further adjustment for insulin, adiposity and SHBG showed positive associations between TT and BP, total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and an inverse association with CRP (all P<0.05), but its relation with HDL-cholesterol was no longer significant.

It is not known if these associations are causal or not. Recently, it has been shown that the serum testosterone levels are associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and we therefore studied the associations between one of these SNPs, rs1799941 on the Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) gene, and MI, T2DM, cancer and death. DNA was prepared from men who participated in the fourth survey of the TromsO Study in 1994-1995 and who were registered with the endpoints MI, T2DM, cancer or death and a randomly selected control group. For mortality, the observation time was set from 1994, and for the other endpoints from birth. The endpoint data were completed up to 2010-2013. Genetic analyses were successfully performed in 5309 men, of whom 1454 were registered with MI, 638 with T2DM, 1534 with cancer and in 2226 who had died. Men with the minor homozygote genotype had significantly higher levels of total testosterone (14.7%) and SHBG (24.7%) compared with men with the major homozygote genotype, whereas free testosterone levels did not differ significantly between the genotypes. The SNP rs1799941 was not significantly associated with MI, T2DM, cancer or mortality.

We used eight population-based cohorts, including 34,538 European-descent individuals (4,407 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 6,073 coronary heart disease (CHD), and 3,813 stroke cases). A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased fasting glucose (0.18 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.24), fasting insulin (8.5%; 95% CI = 5.9-11.1), interleukin-6 (7.0%; 95% CI = 4.0-10.1), and systolic blood pressure (0.70 mmHg; 95% CI = 0.24-1.16) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.02 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.03 to -0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; -0.04 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.07 to -0.01).

Mary","Genetically predicted testosterone and cardiovascular risk factors in men: a Mendelian randomization analysis in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY","Methods To minimize reverse causality, a genetic score predicting testosterone was developed in 289 young Chinese men from Hong Kong, based on three selected testosterone-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10046, rs1008805 and rs1256031). Multivariable censored and linear regressions were used to examine the association of genetically predicted testosterone levels with CVD risk factors and Framingham score among 4212 older Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Results Predicted testosterone was unrelated to systolic blood pressure [-0.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to 0.48], diastolic blood pressure (0.04 mmHg, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.36), fasting glucose (0.02 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06) or Framingham score (0.02, 95% CI -0.0001 to 0.03) but associated with higher LDL-cholesterol (0.02 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04) and lower HDL-cholesterol (-0.01 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.001), after adjustment for potential confounders (age, education, smoking status, use of alcohol and body mass index). Conclusions Our findings did not corroborate observed protective effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors or risk of ischaemic heart disease among men, but raises the possibility that higher testosterone may be associated with an unhealthier lipid profile.",2014,6

Background Higher circulating levels of sPLA(2)-IIA mass or sPLA(2) enzyme activity have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, it is not clear if this association is causal. A recent phase III clinical trial of an sPLA(2) inhibitor (varespladib) was stopped prematurely for lack of efficacy. Methods We conducted a Mendelian randomization meta-analysis of 19 general population studies (8,021 incident, 7,513 prevalent major vascular events [MVE] in 74,683 individuals) and 10 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cohorts (2,520 recurrent MVE in 18,355 individuals) using rs11573156, a variant in PLA2G2A encoding the sPLA(2)-IIA isoenzyme, as an instrumental variable. Results PLA2G2A rs11573156 C allele associated with lower circulating sPLA(2)-IIA mass (38% to 44%) and sPLA(2) enzyme activity (3% to 23%) per C allele. The odds ratio (OR) for MVE per rs11573156 C allele was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98 to 1.06) in general populations and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.03) in ACS cohorts. In the general population studies, the OR derived from the genetic instrumental variable analysis for MVE for a 1-log unit lower sPLA(2)-IIA mass was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.13), and differed from the non-genetic observational estimate (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.79). In the ACS cohorts, both the genetic instrumental variable and observational ORs showed a null association with MVE. Instrumental variable analysis failed to show associations between sPLA2 enzyme activity and MVE. Conclusions Reducing sPLA(2)-IIA mass is unlikely to be a useful therapeutic goal for preventing cardiovascular events. (C) 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation",2013,6

However, it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P < 5 x 10(-8) for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First, we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second, we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD. Finally, in a model accounting for effects on LDL-C and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the strength of a polymorphism's effect on triglyceride levels is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on CAD risk. These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally influence risk for CAD.",2013,6

We used variants in ADH1B and ADH1C genes as instrumental variables (IV) to estimate the causal effect of long-term alcohol consumption on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), lipids, fibrinogen, and glucose. Analyses were undertaken in 54 604 Danes (mean age 56 years). Both confounder-adjusted multivariable and IV analyses suggested that a greater alcohol consumption among those who drank any alcohol resulted in a higher BP [mean difference in SBP per doubling of alcohol consumption among drinkers: 0.76 mmHg (95 CI: 0.63, 0.90) from multivariable analyses and 0.94 mmHg (3.03, 4.69) from IV analyses; P-value for difference in these results 0.95]. The positive association of alcohol with HDLc in the multivariable analyses [4.9 (4.7, 5.1)] appeared stronger than in the IV analyses [1.5 (4.5, 7.4)], and the weak inverse association with fibrinogen in the multivariable analysis [2.0 (2.1, 1.8)] was not present in the IV analyses [0.6 (3.8, 5.0)], but statistically the results for both of these could not be reliably distinguished from each other (P-values 0.21 and 0.32, respectively). The weak inverse association of alcohol with BMI [0.13 kg/m(2) (0.16, 0.10)] and with triglycerides [0.4 (0.7, 0.4)] in multivariable analyses were in contrast to the strong positive association of alcohol with BMI [1.37 kg/m(2) (0.59, 2.15)] and the strong inverse association with triglycerides [14.9 (25.6, 4.3)] in IV analyses; P 0.006 and 0.01, respectively, for difference between the two. Alcohol was not associated with non-HDLc or glucose. Our results show adverse effects of long-term alcohol consumption on BP and BMI.

Design Mendelian randomisation analysis, using variation at specific genes (SLC2A9 (rs7442295) as an instrument for uric acid; and FTO (rs9939609), MC4R (rs17782313), and TMEM18 (rs6548238) for body mass index). Setting Two large, prospective cohort studies in Denmark. Participants We measured levels of uric acid and related covariables in 58 072 participants from the Copenhagen General Population Study and 10 602 from the Copenhagen City Heart Study, comprising 4890 and 2282 cases of ischaemic heart disease, respectively. Main outcome Blood pressure and prospectively assessed ischaemic heart disease. Results Estimates confirmed known observational associations between plasma uric acid and hyperuricaemia with risk of ischaemic heart disease and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. However, when using genotypic instruments for uric acid and hyperuricaemia, we saw no evidence for causal associations between uric acid, ischaemic heart disease, and blood pressure. We used genetic instruments to investigate body mass index as a potentially confounding factor in observational associations, and saw a causal effect on uric acid levels. Every four unit increase of body mass index saw a rise in uric acid of 0.03 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.04), and an increase in risk of hyperuricaemia of 7.5% (3.9% to 11.1%). Conclusion By contrast with observational findings, there is no strong evidence for causal associations between uric acid and ischaemic heart disease or blood pressure. However, evidence supports a causal effect between body mass index and uric acid level and hyperuricaemia. This finding strongly suggests body mass index as a confounder in observational associations, and suggests a role for elevated body mass index or obesity in the development of uric acid related conditions.",2013,6

Whilst the causal relationship is clear for some of these traits, for others it is not. We aimed to determine whether adiposity is causally related to various cardiometabolic traits using the Mendelian randomization approach. Methods and Findings: We used the adiposity-associated variant rs9939609 at the FTO locus as an instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index (BMI) in a Mendelian randomization design. Thirty-six population-based studies of individuals of European descent contributed to the analyses. Age-and sex-adjusted regression models were fitted to test for association between (i) rs9939609 and BMI (n = 198,502), (ii) rs9939609 and 24 traits, and (iii) BMI and 24 traits. The causal effect of BMI on the outcome measures was quantified by IV estimators. The estimators were compared to the BMI-trait associations derived from the same individuals. In the IV analysis, we demonstrated novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.19 per BMI-unit increase; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39) and replicated earlier reports of a causal association with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (odds ratio for IV estimator, 1.1-1.4; all p<0.05). For quantitative traits, our results provide novel evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and confirm previous reports of a causal effect of adiposity on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all p<0.05). The estimated causal effects were in agreement with traditional observational measures in all instances except for type 2 diabetes, where the causal estimate was larger than the observational estimate (p = 0.001). Conclusions: We provide novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and heart failure as well as between adiposity and increased liver enzymes.",2013,6

Genetically elevated bilirubin and risk of ischaemic heart disease: three Mendelian randomization studies and a meta-analysis. J Intern Med 2013; 273: 59-68. Background Elevated plasma levels of bilirubin, an endogenous antioxidant, have been associated with reduced risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Whether this is a causal relationship remains unclear. Objective We tested the hypothesis that elevated plasma bilirubin is causally related to decreased risk of IHD and MI. Design We used a Mendelian randomization approach and three independent studies from Copenhagen, Denmark. We measured bilirubin in 43 708 white individuals from the general population, and genotyped rs6742078 G>T in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene in 67 068 individuals, of whom 11 686 had IHD. Results Third versus first tertile of baseline bilirubin levels was associated with 134% increased bilirubin levels, with sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.760.98; P = 0.02] for IHD and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.660.99; P = 0.04) for MI, but with corresponding multifactorially adjusted HRs of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.821.06; P = 0.29) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.731.12; P = 0.35). UGT1A1 rs6742078 TT versus GG genotype was associated with 95% increased bilirubin levels (P < 0.001); TT versus GG genotype was associated with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.961.11; P = 0.73) for IHD and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.921.12; P = 0.68) for MI. Finally, in a meta-analysis of the present three studies and eight previous studies including a total of 14 711 cases and 60 324 controls, the random effects OR for ischaemic cardiovascular disease for genotypes with approximately 100% increased bilirubin levels versus reference genotypes was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.881.16).

Background LDL-C is causally related to the risk of CHD. However, the association between long-term exposure to lower LDL-C beginning early in life and the risk of CHD has not been reliably quantified. Methods We conducted a series of meta-analyses to estimate the effect of long-term exposure to lower LDL-C on the risk of CHD mediated by 9 polymorphisms in 6 different genes. We then combined these Mendelian randomization studies in a meta-analysis to obtain a more precise estimate of the effect of long-term exposure to lower LDL-C and compared it with the clinical benefit associated with the same magnitude of LDL-C reduction during treatment with a statin. Results All 9 polymorphisms were associated with a highly consistent reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C, with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect (I-2 = 0.0%). In a meta-analysis combining nonoverlapping data from 312,321 participants, naturally random allocation to long-term exposure to lower LDL-C was associated with a 54.5% (95% confidence interval: 48.8% to 59.5%) reduction in the risk of CHD for each mmol/l (38.7 mg/dl) lower LDL-C. This represents a 3-fold greater reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C than that observed during treatment with a statin started later in life (p = 8.43 x 10(-19)). Conclusions Prolonged exposure to lower LDL-C beginning early in life is associated with a substantially greater reduction in the risk of CHD than the current practice of lowering LDL-C beginning later in life.

Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian randomisation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal. Methods We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20 913 myocardial infarction cases, 95 407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12 482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41 331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol. Findings Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2.6% frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0.14 mmol/L higher, p=8x10(-13)) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with non-carriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13% (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.84-0.91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88-1.11, p=0.85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.58-0.66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68-1.26, p=0.63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.45-1.63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.69-2.69, p=2x10(-10)). Interpretation Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial infarction. These data challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.",2012,6

Background Elevated fasting plasma glucose levels associate with increased risk of IHD, but whether this is also true for nonfasting levels and whether this is a causal relationship is unknown. Methods Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 80,522 persons from Copenhagen, Denmark. Of those, IHD developed in 14,155, and MI developed in 6,257. Subjects were genotyped for variants in GCK (rs4607517), G6PC2 (rs560887), ADCY5 (rs11708067), DGKB (rs2191349), and ADRA2A (rs10885122) associated with elevated fasting glucose levels in genome-wide association studies. Results Risk of IHD and MI increased stepwise with increasing nonfasting glucose levels. The hazard ratio for IHD in subjects with nonfasting glucose levels >= 11 mmol/l (>= 198 mg/dl) versus <5 mmol/l (<90 mg/dl) was 6.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2 to 11.2) adjusted for age and sex, and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 4.2) adjusted multifactorially; corresponding values for MI were 9.2 (95% CI: 4.6 to 18.2) and 4.8 (95% CI: 2.1 to 11.2). Increasing number of glucose-increasing alleles was associated with increasing nonfasting glucose levels and with increased risk of IHD and MI. The estimated causal odds ratio for IHD and MI by instrumental variable analysis for a 1-mmol/l (18-mg/dl) increase in nonfasting glucose levels due to genotypes combined were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.52) and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.28 to 2.23), and the corresponding observed hazard ratio for IHD and MI by Cox regression was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.22) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.11), respectively. Conclusions Like common nonfasting glucose elevation, plasma glucose-increasing polymorphisms associate with increased risk of IHD and MI. These data are compatible with a causal association.

However, serum bilirubin is also related with several potential confounders related to CVD, such as obesity. Mendelian randomization has been proposed as a method to address challenges to validity from confounding and reverse causality. It utilizes genotype to estimate causal relationships between a gene product and physiological outcomes. In this report, we demonstrate its use in assessing direct causal relations between serum bilirubin levels and CVD risk factors, including obesity, cholesterol, measures of vascular function and blood pressure. Methods: Study subjects included 868 asymptomatic individuals. Study subjects were genotyped at the UGT1A1*28 locus, which is strongly associated with bilirubin levels. Results: Serum bilirubin levels were inversely associated with levels of several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including body mass index (p = 0.003), LDL (p = 0.0005) and total cholesterol (p = 0.0002). In contrast, UGT1A1*28 genotype, a known cause of elevated bilirubin levels, was not significantly associated with any of these traditional CVD risk factors. We did observe an association between genotype and brachial artery diameter (p = 0.003) and cold pressor reactivity (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings imply that the observed association of serum bilirubin levels with body mass index and cholesterol are likely due to confounding and suggest that previously established CVD benefits of increased bilirubin may in part be mediated by the early regulation of vascular structure and reactivity.",2012,6

Whether this is a causal relation is unclear. Methods: We studied 10,281 participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) and 50,523 participants in the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS), of which 991 and 1,693 participants, respectively, had developed myocardial infarction (MI) by August 2010. Participants in the CCHS were genotyped for all six variants identified by resequencing lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase in 380 individuals. One variant, S208T (rs4986970, allele frequency 4%), associated with HDL cholesterol levels in both the CCHS and the CGPS was used to study causality of HDL cholesterol using instrumental variable analysis. Results: Epidemiologically, in the CCHS, a 13% (0.21 mmol/liter) decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol levels was associated with an 18% increase in risk of MI. S208T associated with a 13% (0.21 mmol/liter) decrease in HDL cholesterol levels but not with increased risk of MI or other ischemic end points. The causal odds ratio for MI for a 50% reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol due to S208T genotype in both studies combined was 0.49 (0.11-2.16), whereas the hazard ratio for MI for a 50% reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol in the CCHS was 2.11 (1.70-2.62) (P-comparison = 0.03). Conclusion: Low plasma HDL cholesterol levels robustly associated with increased risk of MI but genetically decreased HDL cholesterol did not. This may suggest that low HDL cholesterol levels per se do not cause MI. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: E248-E256, 2012)",2012,6

Design Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of individual participant data from 47 epidemiological studies in 15 countries. Participants 194 418 participants, including 46 557 patients with prevalent or incident coronary heart disease. Information was available on four CRP gene tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947), concentration of C reactive protein, and levels of other risk factors. Main outcome measures Risk ratios for coronary heart disease associated with genetically raised C reactive protein versus risk ratios with equivalent differences in C reactive protein concentration itself, adjusted for conventional risk factors and variability in risk factor levels within individuals. Results CRP variants were each associated with up to 30% per allele difference in concentration of C reactive protein (P<10(-34)) and were unrelated to other risk factors. Risk ratios for coronary heart disease per additional copy of an allele associated with raised C reactive protein were 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) for rs3093077; 1.00 (0.98 to 1.02) for rs1205; 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) for rs1130864; and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.03) for rs1800947. In a combined analysis, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.00 (0.90 to 1.13) per 1 SD higher genetically raised natural log (ln) concentration of C reactive protein. The genetic findings were discordant with the risk ratio observed for coronary heart disease of 1.33 (1.23 to 1.43) per 1 SD higher circulating ln concentration of C reactive protein in prospective studies (P=0.001 for difference). Conclusion Human genetic data indicate that C reactive protein concentration itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in coronary heart disease.",2011,6

Mendelian Randomization Using the FTO/MC4R Genotype","HYPERTENSION","Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of experiencing cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and stroke. Current observational data suggest that body mass index may have a causal role in the etiology of hypertension, but this may be influenced by confounding and reverse causation. Through the use of instrumental variable methods, we aim to estimate the strength of the unconfounded and unbiased association between body mass index/adiposity and blood pressure. We explore these issues in the Copenhagen General Population Study. We used instrumental variable methods to obtain estimates of the causal association between body mass index and blood pressure. This was performed using both rs9939609 (FTO) and rs17782313 (MC4R) genotypes as instruments for body mass index. Avoiding the epidemiological problems of confounding, bias, and reverse causation, we confirmed observational associations between body mass index and blood pressure. In analyses including those taking antihypertensive drugs, but for whom appropriate adjustment had been made, systolic blood pressure was seen to increase by 3.85 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.88 to 5.83 mm Hg) for each 10% increase in body mass index (P = 0.0002), with diastolic blood pressure showing an increase of 1.79 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.68 to 2.90 mm Hg) for each 10% increase in body mass index (P = 0.002). Observed associations are large and illustrate the considerable benefits in terms of reductions in blood pressure-related morbidity that could be achieved through a reduction in body mass index.

Individuals homozygous for a +1444C > T polymorphism in the CRP gene have higher circulating concentrations of CRP. Since the distribution of this polymorphism occurs at random during gamete formation, its association with coronary events should not be biased or confounded. Methods We calculated the weighted mean difference in CRP between individuals with variants of the +1444C > T polymorphism in the CRP gene among 4659 European men from six studies (genotype-intermediate phenotype studies). We used this difference together with data from previous observational studies to compute an expected odds ratio (OR) for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) among individuals homozygous for the T allele. We then performed four new genetic association studies (6201 European men) to obtain a summary OR for the association between the +1444C > T polymorphism and non-fatal MI (genotype-disease studies). Results CRP was 0.68 mg/l [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.31-1.10; P = 0.0001] higher among subjects homozygous for the +1444-T allele, with no confounding by a range of covariates. The expected ORs among TT subjects for non-fatal MI corresponding to this difference in CRP was 1.20 (95% CI 1.07-1.38) using the Reykjavik Heart study data and 1.25 (1.09-1.43) for all observational studies to 2004. The estimate for the observed adjusted-OR for non-fatal MI among TT subjects was 1.01 (95% CI 0.74-1.38), lower than both expected ORs. Conclusions A common CRP gene polymorphism is associated with important differences in CRP concentrations, free from confounding. The null association of this variant with coronary events suggests possible residual confounding (or reverse causation) in the CRP-coronary event association in observational studies, though the confidence limits are still compatible with a modest causal effect.

However, whether C-reactive protein is a marker of severity of cardiovascular disease or actually is involved in its pathogenesis remains unknown. We investigated the relation between C-reactive protein haplotypes, representing the comprehensive variation of the C-reactive protein gene, and coronary heart disease. Methods and results The Rotterdam Study is a prospective population-based study among men and women aged 55 years and older. C-reactive protein was associated with risk of coronary heart disease, with a multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of 1.9 (95% Cl 1.5-2.4) for the highest vs. the lowest quartile. Four C-reactive protein haplotypes were present with overall frequencies of 32.8, 31.7, 29.5, and 5.9%. C-reactive protein serum levels were significantly different according to C-reactive protein haplotypes. C-reactive protein haplotypes were not associated with coronary heart disease. Conclusion Steady-state C-reactive protein serum level is influenced by C-reactive protein gene haplotypes.

Methods and Results - We assessed the cross-sectional relations of CRP to systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and prevalent hypertension in a representative sample of > 3500 British women aged 60 to 79 years. For both outcomes, substantial associations were observed. However, these associations were greatly attenuated by adjustment for a wide range of confounding factors acting over the life course. We further investigated causality using a Mendelian randomization approach by examining the association of the 1059G/C polymorphism in the human CRP gene with CRP and with blood pressure, pulse pressure, and hypertension. The polymorphism was associated with a robust difference in CRP, and the expectation would be for higher blood pressure and pulse pressure and greater prevalence of hypertension among those carrying the genetic variant associated with higher CRP levels. This was not observed, and the predicted causal effects of CRP on blood pressure, pulse pressure, and hypertension using instrumental variables methods were close to 0, although with wide CIs.

It remains unclear whether this association is driven entirely by glycemia. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to test whether A1C is causally associated with CAD through glycemic and/or nonglycemic factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To examine the association of A1C with CAD, we selected 50 A1C-associated variants (log(10) Bayes factor >= 6) from an A1C genome-wide association study (GWAS; n = 159,940) and performed an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific causal estimates from CAD GWAS data (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D; 60,801 CAD case subjects/123,504 control subjects). We then replicated results in UK Biobank (18,915 CAD case subjects/455,971 control subjects) and meta-analyzed all results. Next, we conducted analyses using two subsets of variants, 16 variants associated with glycemic measures (fasting or 2-h glucose) and 20 variants associated with erythrocyte indices (e.g., hemoglobin [Hb]) but not glycemic measures. In additional MR analyses, we tested the association of Hb with A1C and CAD. RESULTS Genetically increased A1C was associated with higher CAD risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.61 [95% CI 1.40, 1.84] per %-unit, P = 6.9 x 10(-12)). Higher A1C was associated with increased CAD risk when using only glycemic variants (OR 2.23 [1.73, 2.89], P = 1.0 x 10(-9)) and when using only erythrocytic variants (OR 1.30 [1.08, 1.57], P = 0.006). Genetically decreased Hb, with concomitantly decreased mean corpuscular volume, was associated with higher A1C (0.30 [0.27, 0.33] %-unit, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)) per g/dL and higher CAD risk (OR 1.19 [1.04, 1.37], P = 0.02).

Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization. Methods We used summary statistics data for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B-6 (n = 1), and vitamin B-12 (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases). Results Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.58; p = 6.7 x 10(-4)) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the MTHFR and MUT genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B-6 levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34-0.71; p = 1.3 x 10(-4)) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52-0.94; p = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B-12 levels were not associated with any stroke subtype. Interpretation These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the MTHFR and MUT genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

Results A 1 mmol/L higher genetically determined LDL-C was associated with a 50% higher risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.68, p = 1.1 x 10(-8)). By contrast, the causal effect of LDL-C was much weaker for IS (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96-1.30, p = 0.14; p for heterogeneity = 2.6 x 10(-3)) and, in particular, for cardioembolic stroke (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84-1.33, p = 0.64; p for heterogeneity = 8.6 x 10(-3)) when compared with that for CHD. Conclusions In contrast with the consistent effects of LDL-C-lowering therapies on IS and CHD, genetic variants that confer lifelong LDL-C differences show a weaker effect on IS than on CHD. The relevance of etiologically distinct IS subtypes may contribute to the differences observed.",2019,6

We present a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for glycine in 80,003 participants and investigate the causality and potential mechanisms of the association between glycine and cardio-metabolic diseases using genetic approaches. We identify 27 genetic loci, of which 22 have not previously been reported for glycine. We show that glycine is genetically associated with lower CHD risk and find that this may be partly driven by blood pressure. Evidence for a genetic association of glycine with T2D is weaker, but we find a strong inverse genetic effect of hyperinsulinaemia on glycine. Our findings strengthen evidence for a protective effect of glycine on CHD and show that the glycine-T2D association may be driven by a glycine-lowering effect of insulin resistance.",2019,6

We used the Mendelian randomization study design to examine whether circulating vitamin K-1 (phylloquinone) levels are associated with ischemic stroke. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with vitamin K-1 levels were used as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for large artery atherosclerotic stroke (n = 4373 cases), small vessel stroke (n = 5386 cases), cardioembolic stroke (n = 7193 cases), and any ischemic stroke (n = 34,217 cases and 404,630 non-cases) were available from the MEGASTROKE consortium. Genetically-predicted circulating vitamin K-1 levels were associated with large artery atherosclerotic stroke but not with any other subtypes or ischemic stroke as a whole. The odds ratios per genetically predicted one nmol/L increase in natural log-transformed vitamin K-1 levels were 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.53; p = 7.0 x 10(-4)) for large artery atherosclerotic stroke, 0.98 (95% CI 0.85-1.12; p = 0.73) for small vessel stroke, 1.01 (95% CI 0.90-1.14; p = 0.84) for cardioembolic stroke, and 1.05 (95% CI 0.99-1.11; p = 0.11) for any ischemic stroke.

M.","Genetically predicted milk consumption and bone health, ischemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes: a Mendelian randomization study","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Milk provides protein and micronutrients, and is recommended by some dietary guidelines, particularly for bone health. Meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials suggests that milk may increase bone mineral density, but they are very heterogeneous. No randomized controlled trial has assessed the effects of milk on major chronic diseases. Previous Mendelian randomization studies of milk did not consider bone health, found no effects on ischemic heart disease (IHD) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) but higher body mass index. Using larger genetic studies, we estimated the effects of milk on osteoporosis, IHD, T2D, adiposity, lipids and glycemic traits. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Instrumental variable analysis based on a genetic variant endowing lactase persistence (rs4988235 (MCM6)) was used to obtain estimates for osteoporosis (GEFOS), IHD (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D), T2D (DIAGRAM), adiposity (GIANT), lipids (GLGC) and glycaemic traits (MAGIC). Eye color was a negative control for IHD, as it mirrors the distribution of lactase persistence and IHD in Western Europe. RESULTS: Genetically predicted adult milk consumption was not clearly associated with bone mineral density, IHD (odds ratio (OR): 1.03 per s.d., 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.12) and or T2D (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83-1.02) but was associated with higher log-transformed fasting insulin (0.05, 95% CI: 0.02-0.07) and body mass index (0.06, 95% CI: 0.03-0.09).

However, the nature of the relationship between the two remains unknown. We used a Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the causal effect of serum bilirubin on stroke risk in Koreans. Methods-The 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<10-7) including rs6742078 of uridine diphosphoglucuronyltransferase were selected from genome-wide association study of bilirubin level in the KCPS-II (Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II) Biobank subcohort consisting of 4793 healthy Korean and 806 stroke cases. Weighted genetic risk score was calculated using 14 SNPs selected from the top SNPs. Results-Both rs6742078 (F statistics=138) and weighted genetic risk score with 14 SNPs (F statistics=187) were strongly associated with bilirubin levels. Simultaneously, serum bilirubin level was associated with decreased risk of stroke in an ordinary least-squares analysis. However, in 2-stage least-squares Mendelian randomization analysis, no causal relationship between serum bilirubin and stroke risk was found. Conclusions-There is no evidence that bilirubin level is causally associated with risk of stroke in Koreans. Therefore, bilirubin level is not a risk determinant of stroke.",2017,6

Warfarin, an anticoagulant used in secondary prevention of thrombotic events, is a vitamin K antagonist. Thrombotic and coronary events may share risk factors. Objectives To clarify the role of vitamin K-1 in ischemic heart disease, the risk of coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (CAD/MI) was assessed according to genetically determined vitamin K-1 levels. Given vitamin K-1 is fat soluble, associations with lipids were similarly assessed to assess pleotropic effects via lipids. Methods Separate sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments (Mendelian randomization) was used to obtain an unconfounded estimate of the association of vitamin K-1 (based on rs2108622 [CYP4F2], rs4645543 [KCNK9] and rs2192574 [CTNNA2] from a genome-wide association study) with CAD/MI using CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (cases = 64 374; controls = 130 681) and with lipids using Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n = 196 475).

OBJECTIVES Through a Mendelian randomization approach, we assessed whether serum urate levels are causally relevant in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and heart failure (HF). METHODS This study investigated 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to regulate serum urate levels in association with various vascular and nonvascular risk factors to assess pleiotropy. To limit genetic confounding, 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms exclusively associated with serum urate levels were used in a genetic risk score to assess associations with the following cardiometabolic diseases (cases/controls): T2DM (26,488/83,964), CHD (54,501/68,275), ischemic stroke (14,779/67,312), and HF (4,526/18,400). As a positive control, this study also investigated our genetic instrument in 3,151 gout cases and 68,350 controls. RESULTS Serum urate levels, increased by 1 SD due to the genetic score, were not associated with T2DM, CHD, ischemic stroke, or HF. These results were in contrast with previous prospective studies that did observe increased risks of these 4 cardiometabolic diseases for an equivalent increase in circulating urate levels. However, a 1 SD increase in serum urate levels due to the genetic score was associated with increased risk of gout (odds ratio: 5.84; 95% confidence interval: 4.56 to 7.49), which was directionally consistent with previous observations. CONCLUSIONS Evidence from this study does not support a causal role of circulating serum urate levels in T2DM, CHD, ischemic stroke, or HF. Decreasing serum urate levels may not translate into risk reductions for cardiometabolic conditions. (C) 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",2016,6

Background: LDL-C is causally related to the risk of CHD. However, the association between long-term exposure to lower LDL-C beginning early in life and the risk of CHD has not been reliably quantified. Methods: We conducted a series of meta-analyses to estimate the effect of long-term exposure to lower LDL-C on the risk of CHD mediated by 9 polymorphisms in 6 different genes. We then combined these Mendelian randomization studies in a meta-analysis to obtain a more precise estimate of the effect of long-term exposure to lower LDL-C and compared it with the clinical benefit associated with the same magnitude of LDL-C reduction during treatment with a statin. Results: All 9 polymorphisms were associated with a highly consistent reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C, with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect (1(2) = 0.0%). In a meta-analysis combining nonoverlapping data from 312,321 participants, naturally random allocation to long-term exposure to lower LDL-C was associated with a 54.5% (95% confidence interval: 48.8% to 59.5%) reduction in the risk of CHD for each mmol/l (383 mg/dl) lower LDL-C. This represents a 3-fold greater reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C than that observed during treatment with a statin started later in life (p = 8.43 x 10(-19)). Conclusions: Prolonged exposure to lower LDL-C beginning early in life is associated with a substantially greater reduction in the risk of CHD than the current practice of lowering LDL-C beginning later in life.",2013,6

We investigated the relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphism at position -148 in the beta-fibrinogen gene promoter (beta - 148C/T), blood fibrinogen levels, and risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in sufficiently large numbers of coronary disease cases to reliably address this question. Methods Genotyping and measurement of blood fibrinogen concentration were carried out in 4685 cases of confirmed MI and 3460 controls with no history of coronary disease. A meta-analysis of ISIS and 19 other studies of beta-fibrinogen genotypes involving a total of 12 220 coronary disease cases and 18 716 controls was conducted. Results Among the ISIS controls, mean plasma fibrinogen concentrations with the C/C, C/T and T/T genotypes were 3.34 (SE 0.015), 3.48 (0.022), and 3.60 (0.064) g/l, respectively, corresponding to an increase of 0.14 (0.024) g/l per T allele (trend P < 0.0001). In the case-control comparison, 0.14 g/l higher usual plasma fibrinogen concentration was associated with an age-adjusted and sex-adjusted risk ratio for MI of 1.17 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.14-1.19; P < 0.0001]. But, after further adjustment for smoking, body mass index, and plasma apolipoprotein B/A(1) ratio, this risk ratio fell to 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.05; P = 0.05). Moreover, fibrinogen genotype was not significantly associated with MI incidence: risk ratio of 1.06 (95% CI 0.96-1.16) per higher-fibrinogen allele in ISIS alone and of 1.00 (95% CI 0.95-1.04) per allele in the meta-analysis. Conclusions Genotypes that produce lifelong differences in fibrinogen concentrations do not materially influence coronary disease incidence. As these genotype-dependent differences in fibrinogen were allocated randomly at conception (Mendelian randomization), this association is not likely to be confounded by other factors. Consequently, these genetic results provide strong evidence that long-term differences in fibrinogen concentrations are not a major determinant of coronary disease risk.",2006,6

However, such associations may be attributable to confounding from environmental factors. This study uses the Mendelian randomization technique to overcome these limitations by investigating the association between genetic variants related to iron status and stroke risk. Methods-A study of 48 972 subjects performed by the Genetics of Iron Status consortium identified genetic variants with concordant relations to 4 biomarkers of iron status (serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, and transferrin) that supported their use as instruments for overall iron status. Genetic estimates from the MEGASTROKE consortium were used to investigate the association between the same genetic variants and stroke risk. The 2-sample ratio method Mendelian randomization approach was used for the main analysis, with the MR-Egger and weighted median techniques used in sensitivity analyses. Results-The main results, reported as odds ratio (OR) of stroke per SD unit increase in genetically determined iron status biomarker, showed a detrimental effect of increased iron status on stroke risk (serum iron OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14; [log-transformed] ferritin OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36; and transferrin saturation OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11). A higher transferrin, indicative of lower iron status, was also associated with decreased stroke risk (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99). Examining ischemic stroke subtypes, we found the detrimental effect of iron status to be driven by cardioembolic stroke. These results were supported in statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants. Conclusions-This study provides Mendelian randomization evidence that higher iron status is associated with increased stroke risk and, in particular, cardioembolic stroke. Further work is required to investigate the underlying mechanism and whether this can be targeted in preventative strategies.",2018,6

We sought to determine whether S-25OHD concentrations are causally associated with ischemic stroke and its subtypes using Mendelian randomization. Methods-We used summary-level data for ischemic stroke (34 217 cases and 404 630 noncases) from the MEGASTROKE consortium. As instruments, we used 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms, explaining 7.5% of the variance in S-25OHD, previously identified to be associated with S-25OHD concentrations in the Study of Underlying Genetic Determinants of Vitamin D and Highly Related Traits consortium (n=79 366). The analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance-weighted method and complemented with the weighted median, heterogeneity-penalized, and Mendelian randomization-Egger approaches. Results-Genetically higher S-25OHD concentration was not associated with ischemic stroke. The odds ratios (95% CI) per genetically predicted 1-SD (approximate to 18 nmol/L) increase in S-25OHD concentrations, based on all 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms, were 1.01 (0.94-1.08; P=0.84) for all ischemic stroke, 0.94 (0.80-1.11; P=0.49) for large artery stroke, 0.95 (0.82-1.11; P=0.55) for small vessel stroke, and 1.02 (0.90-1.16; P=0.74) for cardioembolic stroke. The results were similar in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions-These findings provide no support that higher S-25OHD concentrations are causally associated with any ischemic stroke subtype.

However, more evidence is needed to answer the question whether LDL cholesterol plays a causal role in ischemic stroke subtypes. In addition, it is unknown whether high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides have a causal relationship to ischemic stroke and its subtypes. Our aim was to investigate the causal role of LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in ischemic stroke and its subtypes through Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods-Summary data on 185 genome-wide lipids-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium and the Stroke Genetics Network for their association with ischemic stroke (n=16 851 cases and 32 473 controls) and its subtypes, including large artery atherosclerosis (n=2410), small artery occlusion (n=3186), and cardioembolic (n=3427) stroke. Inverse-variance-weighted MR was used to obtain the causal estimates. Inverse-variance-weighted multivariable MR, MR-Egger, and sensitivity exclusion of pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms after Steiger filtering and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier test were used to adjust for pleiotropic bias. Results-A 1-SD genetically elevated LDL cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.20) and large artery atherosclerosis stroke (odds ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.49) but not with small artery occlusion or cardioembolic stroke in multivariable MR. A 1-SD genetically elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with a decreased risk of small artery occlusion stroke (odds ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.90) in multivariable MR. MR-Egger indicated no pleiotropic bias, and results did not markedly change after sensitivity exclusion of pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genetically elevated triglycerides did not associate with ischemic stroke or its subtypes. Conclusions-LDL cholesterol lowering is likely to prevent large artery atherosclerosis but may not prevent small artery occlusion nor cardioembolic strokes. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol elevation may lead to benefits in small artery disease prevention. Finally, triglyceride lowering may not yield benefits in ischemic stroke and its subtypes.",2018,6

We undertook a Mendelian randomization study to determine whether DBP levels have causal effects on common calcemic and cardiometabolic disease. Methods and Findings: We measured DBP and 25OHD levels in 2,254 individuals, followed for up to 10 y, in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). Using the single nucleotide polymorphism rs2282679 as an instrumental variable, we applied Mendelian randomization methods to determine the causal effect of DBP on calcemic (osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism) and cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and stroke) and related traits, first in CaMos and then in large-scale genome-wide association study consortia. The effect allele was associated with an age-and sex-adjusted decrease in DBP level of 27.4 mg/l (95% CI 24.7, 30.0; n = 2,254). DBP had a strong observational and causal association with 25OHD levels (p = 3.2 x 10(-19)). While DBP levels were observationally associated with calcium and body mass index (BMI), these associations were not supported by causal analyses. Despite well-powered sample sizes from consortia, there were no associations of rs2282679 with any other traits and diseases: fasting glucose (0.00 mmol/l [95% CI -0.01, 0.01]; p = 1.00; n = 46,186); fasting insulin (0.01 pmol/l [95% CI -0.00, 0.01,]; p = 0.22; n = 46,186); BMI (0.00 kg/m(2) [95% CI -0.01, 0.01]; p = 0.80; n = 127,587); bone mineral density (0.01 g/cm(2) [95% CI -0.01, 0.03]; p = 0.36; n = 32,961); mean arterial pressure (-0.06 mm Hg [95% CI -0.19, 0.07]); p = 0.36; n = 28,775); ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00 [95% CI 0.97, 1.04]; p = 0.92; n = 12,389/62,004 cases/controls); coronary artery disease (OR = 1.02 [95% CI 0.99, 1.05]; p = 0.31; n = 22,233/64,762); or type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.01 [95% CI 0.97, 1.05]; p = 0.76; n = 9,580/53,810). Conclusions: DBP has no demonstrable causal effect on any of the diseases or traits investigated here, except 25OHD levels. It remains to be determined whether 25OHD has a causal effect on these outcomes independent of DBP.",2014,6
